Hanging on zoom?

We are aware that in Windows XP, QGIS may hang easily when zooming with an NBN WMS map displayed. This has been reported for QGIS versions 2.4 and version 2.6. Windows 7 and Windows 8 appear to be okay. If you zoom carefully with XP, ensuring that you wait for the map to refresh before zooming again, you can avoid hanging. If you are an XP user, you may find it easier to avoid accidental multiple zooms if you turn off the mouse-wheel zoom from the QGIS settings menu (settings, options, map tools: set mouse wheel action to nothing). 

"SSL Expired Certificate" error?

This message has been reported by Windows XP users when using the NBN WMS for QGIS version 2.4 onwards. But it doesn't seem to stop the tool being used.

NBN Web service availability

This tool relies on two NBN web services (Taxon Dictionary and Web Mapping Service). Either may, on rare occasions, be unavailable, which could result in unexpected behaviour.
