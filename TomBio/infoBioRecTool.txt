Interface changes for batch generation

Release 1.3 of the tools has introduced substantial changes in the interface for the Biological Recording tool. This is to incorporate new work flows that work with the new map rendering and refreshing behaviour of QGIS introduced with QGIS version 2.4. This replaces the workaround provided in version 1.2 of this tool.

A new tutorial video will shortly be added to the YouTube help for this tool to demonstrate how the new interface works, but it should mostly be discernible from the tool-tips on the buttons. Generating batch map images is now a two stage process - generate the map layers and then generate the map images (replacing the individual stepped, image creation of the workaround in version 1.2). Make sure all your map layers are visible before clicking the map image generation button.

One VERY important point is that the new QGIS rendering model makes map layer generation from this tool very slow if backround layers are genrated with WMS (web mapping services). If you are finding map or image generation very slow, use this workflow: first get your map background just right (using WMS if you like) and then use the QGIS facility to save the map as a raster image. Now turn off all your background layers and load the single raster image you just created - it will look exactly the same but will avoid calls to WMS during map and image generation.

This will be demonstrated in the new tutorial video. Good luck!
