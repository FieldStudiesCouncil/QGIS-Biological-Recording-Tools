Dynamic Layers vs Dynamic sub-layers

The 'dynamic sub-layers' option should create one layer from the NBN and set the visibility of the sub-layers (hidden in the layer viewer) depending on the scale. This works well for versions of QGIS up to 2.4.0 (Chugiak). From that version onwards, including the current 2.6 (Brighton) version, only the yellow hectad sub-layer is shown in the map, whatever the zoom level. It seems as though QGIS' handling of sub-layers has stopped working correctly. I will look into this with QGIS.

In the meantime, for versions 2.4.0 (Chugiak) onwards, you can use the 'dynamic layers' workaround option instead. The main difference is that you get four layers instead of one - each with a single layer with visibility set according to the zoom level.

Hanging on zoom?

We are aware that for some combinations of QGIS versions and Windows operating systems, QGIS hangs easily when zooming with an NBN WMS map displayed. This has been reported for version 2.4.0 (Chugiak) and version 2.6 (Brighton) with Windows XP. Windows 7 and Windows 8 appear to be okay.

Strange "SSL Expired Certificate" error?

Again this has been reported when using the NBN WMS for certain combinations of QGIS versions and Windows operating systems such as 2.4.0 (Chugiak) with Windows XP. But it doesn't seem to stop the tool being used.

NBN Web service availability

This tool relies on two NBN web services (Taxon Dictionary and Web Mapping Service). Either may, on rare occassions, be unavailable, which could result in unexpected behaviour.
