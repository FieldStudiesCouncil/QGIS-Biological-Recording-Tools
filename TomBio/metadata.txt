description=FSC Tomorrow's Biodiversity productivity tools for biological recorders.
about=This is a plugin for QGIS desktop GIS which is aimed initially at 
    biological recorders. It streamlines many of the tasks commonly  
	required from GIS by biological recorders including viewing NBN  
	maps (via the NBN WMS), displaying biological records from CSV files, 
	working with UK OS grid references and registering raster map images  
	from the internet. Although originally designed for use in the the UK, 
	enhancements have been made to improved utility in any geographical 
	context.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog entries:
changelog=1.4.2
    - Enhancement to Map Mashup to allow image to be pasted from 
	a file instead of the clipboard. Also to allow the application
	of a style file to the registered raster image.
  1.4.1
    - Bug-fix to improve processing for CSV files with many taxa.
  1.4.0
	- Updated the Biological Records tool with two main enhancements.
	1. Allows maps to be generated from X & Y values stored in any
	CRS. Specify grid sizes directly - must be specified in the map
	units used by the output CRS.
	2. Improved internal handling of Comma Separated Value records
	files which means performance improvements and ability to handle
	much larger files.
  1.3.4
    - Updated the OSGR tool so that it supports non-UK based coordinate
	reference systems and allows generation of grids at user-specified sizes,
	whatever coordinate reference system is used (including OSGB).
  1.3.3
    - Incorporated changes to make better use of the new multi-threaded
	rendering (MTR) model. This should improve the performance of batch
	atlas map layer and image generation in most circumstances.
  1.3.2
    - Made changes to speed up generation of layers and batch images when
	large rasters or WMS are used for a backdrop.
	- Updated tool info files and tool metadata.
  1.3.1
    - Fixed issue with backward compatibility with version 2.
  1.3.0
	- Incorporates major change to Biological Records tool to cope with the new 
	rendering mechanism (MTS) introduced with version 2.4 of QGIS. This 
	replaces the workarounds introduced in version 1.2.0. The information 
	file (invoked from the options tab) gives a bit of information on using 
	the new interface.
  1.2.1
    - Incorporates a few bug fixes, better information for problems and workarounds.
  1.2.0
    - Workaround for issue with batch map image generation in Biological Records tool.
  1.1.0
    - Workaround for issue with 'auto' layer in NBN tool in newer versions of QGIS.
  1.0.2
    - Addresses problems with initialising environment variables.
