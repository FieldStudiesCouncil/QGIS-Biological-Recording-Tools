qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=FSC Tomorrow's Biodiversity productivity tools for biological recorders.
about=This is a plugin for QGIS desktop GIS which is aimed specifically at biological 
    recorders working with UK OS grid referenced data. 
	It streamlines many of the tasks commonly required from GIS by 
	biological recorders including viewing NBN maps (via the NBN WMS), 
	displaying biological records derived from CSV file, working with 
	OS grid references and registering raster map images from the internet. 
	Although most of these tools are relevant only in the UK context,
	the Map Mashup tool may also be useful to people working elsewhere.
