The FSC QGIS Plugin
======================

This is a QGIS plugin designed specifically for UK biological recorders. The plugin streamlines many of the GIS tasks commonly undertaken by biological recordes including displaying biological records derived from CSV file, working with OS grid references, viewing NBN maps (via the NBN WMS) within QGIS and registering raster map images from the internet.

The plugin was written for version 2 of QGIS and the last QGIS v2 compatible version of this plugin is 2.8.0. Versions of this plugin compatible with QGIS v3 also have a major version number of 3 (e.g. 3.0.0).
