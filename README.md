The TomBio QGIS Plugin
======================

This is a QGIS plugin designed specifically for UK biological recorders. The plugin streamlines many of the GIS tasks commonly undertaken by biological recordes including displaying biological records derived from CSV file, working with OS grid references, viewing NBN maps (via the NBN WMS) within QGIS and registering raster map images from the internet.

The plugin was written for version 2 of QGIS, but it is our intention to make a QGIS version 3 compatible release of the tool before the end of April 2018.
