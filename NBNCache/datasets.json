This can be achieved by a method of counting the number of Nephrops burrows within a fishery ground, as established by the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department, Aberdeen. Nephrops stock is estimated via prior knowledge of the sea bed and of Nephrops grounds. Burrow counts viewed by means of UWTV aids in the process of establishing the number of burrows, and therefore stock, of the whole fishery ground. The number of Nephrops burrow counts is converted to biomass with the incorporation of empty burrows recognized. This method of stock assessment is reliable, however accurate Nephrops burrow identification and counts are required. There must also be a realistic count of unoccupied burrows for the stock assessment to be precise. The report investigates Nephrops burrow morphology for identification purposes during counts. Resin casts of Nephrops burrows were obtained from a sea loch site and from previous collections held at the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM) and the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD). Burrow temporal morphology was investigated using SCUBA diver observations at two sea loch sites. In situ studies of Nephrops populations were undertaken at two Scottish (west coast) study areas, Loch Sween and Loch Riddon, by means of SCUBA diving. Two study sites in Loch Sween were established for mapping purposes. Nephrops populations were also examined by observing videotape footage obtained in Scottish, Swedish and Mediterranean waters obtained by UWTV. Data recorded, by DANI (Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland), from the Irish Sea also supplemented the research project. A third study site, in the Achnamara arm of Loch Sween, was set up for the purpose of burrow resin casting. Resin casts of Nephrops burrows were examined and collated to determine the complexity of burrows. Burrow dynamics and longevity were examined. The Loch Riddon study site was utilized for mapping and resin casting purposes. The report also investigated the burrows of other co-inhabiting species. A key is provided to aid in the identification of species burrows based on the observations of surface features. This would prove valid for those wishing to use the UWTV-based stock assessment method as precision counts of only Nephrops burrows would be achieved. Ground suitability for UWTV based stock assessment for Nephrops is discussed. Recommendations for the UWTV method of stock assessment is provided.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"University Marine Biological Station Millport","captureMethod":"This study was conducted by scientists at the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM) and the Institute of Marine Biology of Crete (IMBC). Research consultation was established with members of the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD), the Istituto di Ricerche sulla Pesca Marittima, Ancona, Italy (IRPEM) and the Institute of Marine Research, Lysekil, Sweden (IMRL). The Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland (DANI) provided the project with data. The study project has been supported by financial assistance of the European Commission. The report does not necessarily reflect the views of the European Commission. The study project is in support of the Common Fisheries Policy. The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, is a commercially important shellfish species in Scotland and in the rest of Europe. Stock assessment within fisheries relies on the data presented by the fishery which is supplemented by commercial and research vessel catches. Such methods of stock assessment are not entirely reliable as catch estimates vary with the sex and size of the animal, time of day, season and sediment type of the ground. A more reliable, precise method of stock assessment is required. Such a method was devised by SOAEFD and has been adopted by other institutions. The method is based on estimating the number of Nephrops within a fishery ground by counting the occupied burrows. This is achieved by the use of underwater television (UWTV). The method relies heavily on the accurate identification and recognition of Nephrops burrows. Nephrops burrows were cast in resin during the project to enable an insight into burrow morphology, complexity and diversity. One hundred and forty eight resin casts were investigated, which included new casts and those previously collected by UMBSM and SOAEFD. UWTV video tape and still photographs displaying Nephrops burrows and fishing grounds from the UK and Europe were analyzed. The colour cameras used in Scottish investigations were Simrad Osprey OE1362 and OE1364. Both cameras had a fixed focal lens and a wide field of view. A flotation device was attached to the camera cable and the tow reached a speed of less than 1 knot to prevent sediment disturbance. An underwater stills camera, supplied by SOAEFD, was occasionally used in conjunction with the UWTV. A Hasselblad 70mm underwater stills camera, equipped with a 50mm lens, 70 frame film magazine and twin strobe flashes (Simrad Osprey) was used. Both cameras were aligned to view the same area. Particular Nephrops grounds were examined for their suitability to use UWTV as a method of stock assessment. Over populated areas and those which included conspicuous species burrows suggested a high error rate for stock assessment and extra care must be utilised when assessing such Nephrops grounds. Larger burrows were identified as being only partially visible to the UWTV camera. By using divers to assess Nephrops burrows along a previously UWTV tow path, exact numbers could be counted. It was identified that not all burrows could be observed on the corresponding video tape. Allowances into partially sighted burrows and occupancy assessments had to be established for stock assessments to be as precise as possible and not over estimated. UWTV research within Scottish sites was carried out using the UMBSM research vessel RV Aora. The two project partners, UMBSM and IMBC, investigated methods of stock assessment in Nephrops grounds in the Scottish west coast and the Aegean respectively. Loch Sween and Loch Riddon (both in western Argyll) were sites investigated in Scotland. Both are sea lochs which have Nephrops grounds. Loch Sween has a varying and dense range of burrowing megafauna which was useful in establishing the problems for UWTV stock assessments.

It occurs in the same habitat as Koenigia (loose, basalt gravel) and can readily be counted at the same time. It is hoped that simultaneous observations of population trends in the two species may give greater insight into the reasons for change.","geographicalCoverage":"Monitoring sites on the summit of Bearraich, on the western tip of the Ardmeanach peninsula, Isle of Mull, Scotland.

Individual plants of Koenigia islandica can be very small (>5mm) and it is likely that some will be missed in each quadrat.  Recorder error is likely to be slightly higher where counts are particularly high. There is some variation in emergence and flowering date between years and it is possible that some observations may have been made before peak emergence of Koenigia islandica or after flowering and dieback of Sedum villosum.

In the 1970s, an estimated 8000ha of the habitat was drained each year.  The loss of wet lowland grassland and reduction in quality has particularly affected some wader species, which in the past have been more or less dependent on it.  The BTO and RSPB have run two main surveys (1982 and 2002) to identify all areas of damp lowland grassland in England and Wales and to count the numbers of breeding waders using them.  Five main species were counted: Lapwing <i>Vanellus vanellus</i>, Snipe <i>Gallinago gallinago</i>, Curlew <i>Numenius arquata</i>, Redshank <i>Tringa totanus</i> and Oystercatcher <i>Haematopus ostralegus</i>.  Other rare breeding waders, which they came across were recorded, including Avocet <i>Recurvirostra avosetta</i>, Little Ringed Plover <i>Charadrius dubius</i> Ringed Plover <i>C. hiaticula</i>, Black-tailed Godwit <i>Limosa limosa</i>, Ruff <i>Philomachus pugnax</i> and Common Sandpiper <i>Actitis hypoleucos</i> as well as any Yellow Wagtails <i>Motacilla flava</i>  However, this dataset only includes records of the five main species.\r\n</br>\r\nThe surveys were intended to give an assessment of the remaining grasslands and their bird populations, and provide an inventory of the most important sites to aid the conservation of the species.  The data included in this dataset are a summary of the number of birds in a site, which is represented as the central 1km grid square.\r\n</br>\r\nThe problems of agricultural improvement are no less acute in Scotland, where the breeding wader populations of the straths and glens are under severe pressure.  In 1982, a parallel survey of Breeding Waders of Scottish Agricultural Land was launched by Hector Galbraith and continued in 1983, looking at the same five wader species on all agricultural land (see Galbraith & Furness 1983 <i>Scottish Birds</i> 12: 148-153).\r\n</br>\r\nIn both surveys, many of the birds found were on nature reserves, or other sites which had some form of protection from detrimental agricultural practices.  Despite the protected nature of these sites, it is thought that the declines have continued and so careful management of all sites is essential to try to halt the declines.  On a wider-scale and in the longer term, more carefully targeted agri-environment schemes may hold the key to reversing declines.\r\n</br>\r\n1982 survey:  1178 grassland sites in England and Wales were surveyed in 1982.  In addition, a pilot survey in 1980 and 1981 covered 104 sites, which were not repeated during the main survey of 1982.  Although the pilot survey data are not included in this dataset, a total of 1282 sites were surveyed covering approximately 240000ha.  The area could be measured for 944 sites, and ranged from 2 ha to 1097ha with a median of 71ha (upper and lower quartiles 146ha and 30ha).  Of the five key wader species, 11995 pairs were reported (6721 Lapwing, 1979 drumming Snipe, 540 Curlew, 2218 Redshank and 537 Oystercatcher).  The total number of pairs exceeded 1000 in three counties: Norfolk (1983 pairs on 149 sites), Cambridgeshire (1422 pairs on 60 sites) and Kent (1262 pairs on 50 sites).  It was particularly noted that 48% of the Snipe and 36% of the Redshank were found on just five sites - the Ouse Washes, Nene Washes, North Kent marshes, Derwent Ings and Somerset Levels.  Even in 1982, both species were unusual breeding birds over most of the lowlands.\r\n</br>\r\nThere was more than 30% artificial habitat on 97 sites (7.6% of the grassland sites surveyed). Artificial sites included 53 gravel pits, six sewage works, eight reservoirs and 30 other unclassified industrial sites.  In total, these sites held 840 pairs of waders, and although a small fraction of the overall total (7.0%) the sites were very important in some counties, especially some inland ones.  On another 79 sites surveyed, there was m","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"British Trust for Ornithology","captureMethod":"The surveys were designed to cover all wet lowland grassland sites.  This site type was defined broadly as any area of grassland subject to freshwater flooding or waterlogging. Floodplain grasslands, coastal grazing marshes and washlands are included, as well as isolated pockets of poorly drained grassland. The survey was aimed primarily at lowland grasslands and coverage was arbitrarily restricted to land below 183m (600ft) in altitude, and therefore, the uplands and their fringes were specifically excluded. Similarly, no attempt was made to survey any areas subject to regular tidal flooding.  Guidelines were used to define the areas to be surveyed.  Sites were selected initially by reference to the BTO Register of Ornithological Sites, water authority reports of land drainage needs, and county bird reports. BTO regional representatives, RSPB regional officers, National Agency and County Wildlife Trust officers, and county bird recorders were then consulted to produce a final list of areas that were thought to be worthy of survey in each county.  All areas selected were divided into sites, and each site consisted of a geographically-defined area, which could be covered easily in one visit. A final comprehensive list of approximately 1,200 sites was produced for England and Wales. This list was thought to include all the major lowland breeding wader sites within the survey definition.  In some counties, it was possible to include habitats such as gravel pits and sewage works, which were known to hold breeding waders, even though they could not strictly be defined as damp (or wet) grasslands.\r\n</br>\r\nMost of the particular sites surveyed in 2002 were those surveyed in 1982. However, more rigorous application of the criteria for the 2002 survey meant some original sites were excluded as they failed to meet the habitat criteria of being grassland below the altitude limit. Also excluded were locations such as the gravel pits, salt marshes or arable land. A number of additional sites were identified for the 2002 survey following extensive consultation with regional staff from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and English Nature (now Natural England), and the regional representatives of the British Trust for Ornithology. Some of these additional sites were areas of wet grassland created since 1982 while others were simply not covered in the previous survey. \r\n</br>\r\nThe fieldwork was mainly carried out by volunteer fieldworkers and was organised through the national network of BTO regional representatives.  However, in some areas there were large numbers of sites (eg Norfolk in 1982 and the Norfolk Broads, Somerset Levels and North Kent Marshes in 2002), in which volunteer surveys were supplemented by the work of some employed surveyors.  For example, in Norfolk in 1982, two full-time fieldworkers were employed under the Manpower Services Commission Community Enterprises Project.\r\n</br>\r\nThe methods used in the field were identical in the two surveys.  Observers were asked to make three visits between April and early June. They walked through each field systematically, aiming to get to within 100m of the entire survey area. They counted total number of each wader species seen or heard, and marked their locations on a 1:25000 scale map. In addition, the observers were asked to estimate the numbers of pairs they thought were present on each visit.  Observers completed visits before midday and avoided adverse weather conditions of rain or moderate to high wind. To minimise disturbance, they were not encouraged specifically to look for nests or broods, but were asked to record any that were seen in the course of the survey. It was possible that some pairs would be missed on some visits. Therefore, final overall assessments of the number of pairs present on each site were made by the observers. In 2002 in addition to the wader observations, records of other wetland species were specifically requested: Teal <i>Ana","purpose":"The aim of the surveys was to provide information on the species? current status.

When found, the spawn mat size was measured, number of clumps were counted and habitat around the spawn was surveyed. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nNewt survey method: Bottle trap surveys were conducted between 15th March and 4th June.  Six rounds of trapping were carried out at each site at fortnightly intervals.  Although we can never be certain of newt absence, six repeats was deemed enough to give a confident estimate of where newts were present and absent (Sewell, D. pers. comm.)  Traps were placed on 40 randomly allocated transects around each reserve, spaced to be as independent as possible.  Each transect had ten newt traps, spaced 2 m apart.  Number of newts and small fish caught in traps were recorded.  The transect habitat was surveyed, including measures of water quality, vegetation and habitat structure.  For analysis, comparisons of habitat variables were made between transects with and without newts.  In addition, habitat variables were tested to see which related most strongly to the maximum number of newts caught on each transect over the six rounds of trapping. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nMarsh Frog survey method: Any sightings or calls throughout the 2010 survey season were marked on a map to estimate distribution. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe aim was to cover the whole reserve via a pre-plotted transect route.  Known ponds were marked on the map to ensure these were surveyed.   There were 25 survey points at Stodmarsh and 27 at Ham Wall, sampled 3 times over the week. The transect route was varied each day to randomise the time of day each survey point was sampled.  Every 500 m along the transect, calls were listened for over 2 minutes, forwards 250m and backwards 250m along the transect.  Records were made of whether calls were in the front 250m or the behind 250m, on the near side bank or opposite bank across the ditch/water.  Then a 15 second sound clip of marsh frogs calling was played using the MP3 player and speaker.  Again 2 minutes of listening in the areas specified above was carried out.   In addition, walking along a 10m stretch of bank flushed frogs into the water.  This was either seen or a distinctive plop sound was heard and the number of individuals counted.  Marsh frogs seen or heard between survey points were added to the distribution map.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSurveys were designed by Donna Harris (former RSPB project officer) with expert advice from various herpetologists.

","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"RSPB","captureMethod":"<b>Invertebrates</b>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Water trap survey methods</b>: Water traps were set at 21 randomly allocated locations at each of the three sites within three hydrological strata based on the best information available.  Water traps consisted of a 1.3L plastic food container, painted with \"buttercup yellow\" plasticote spray paint, with a mesh-covered hole drilled in the side to minimise over-flow.  Traps were filled with 500ml of 40% propylene glycol solution to which a couple of drops of washing up liquid were added to reduce surface tension so that invertebrates didn?t float or escape.   Each trap was placed on a platform which was nailed to a tree pole at chest height within a circular, 1m radius plot of trampled reed. This trampled reed core was deliberately created to standardise microhabitat influence between trap points.  Each trap was protected from bird or vertebrate interference by 2cm garden netting.   Traps were active for two weeks in June/July 2009 after which the surveyors collected the contents and reset the traps which were then left in situ for a further two weeks.  A habitat survey within the 3 m radius of the trap point was carried out.  This included measures of reed structure, distance to scrub, plant diversity, water levels and litter levels.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Pitfall trap survey methods</b>: Pitfall traps were set at 24 locations at Stodmarsh, 22 locations at Hickling Broad and 12 locations at Ham Wall.  Surveys were carried out in August 2009.  All sampling points had to be dry during surveys, and Ham Wall had a lower sample size because less dry reedbed was available.  Pitfall traps consisted of 400ml plastic flip top containers (Alana Ecology) that were dug in to the ground ensuring that the soil is compact and flush to the rim. The containers were 1/3 full with propylene glycol solution (50%) and a few drops of washing up liquid.  Plastic garden mesh covers were pinned over traps to prevent larger creatures falling in and drowning.  Pitfall traps were collected 16 days after set up.  Samples were washed through filter mesh and stored in 60% Industrial Methylated Spirits.  A habitat survey within the 3 m radius of the trap point was carried out.  This included measures of reed structure, distance to scrub, plant diversity, water levels and litter levels.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Moth trap survey methods</b>: Twelve moth trap sampling points at each of the three sites were surveyed for moths in 2010 using Heath type 15 W actinic traps.  Points were selected randomly and all available water level information was used to try to ensure a range of hydrological strata were surveyed.   Each trap was set three times, at intervals of three weeks between June and August 2010.  Four traps were set up each night before dusk and checked at 6 am the following morning to identify species and count individuals.   Traps were fitted with rain-guards and used 12 Amp hour batteries, attached to the poles to stay dry.  One large egg box tray (roughly 30cm square) ripped into six pieces lined the base of the trap.  Traps were fitted firmly to platforms on top of wooden poles as in the water trap survey and pole height was recorded.  A habitat survey within the 3 m radius of the trap point was carried out.  This included measures of reed structure, distance to scrub, plant diversity, water levels and litter levels.\r\n\r\nAquatic Netting\r\n\r\nNetting surveys were carried out for aquatic invertebrates at the three key reedbed sites (Ham Wall, Hickling Broad and Stodmarsh).  Reed blocks, open water and ditch habitats were sampled between 13th and 23rd July 2009.  The sampling method involved taking 8 samples (that were at least 50 m apart) from each habitat category, sweeping for 5-minutes at each sampling point with a standard pond net (with 1mm mesh). The sample was then placed in a coarse sieve (1cm mesh) placed on a finer sieve (500 microns) which in turn was placed in a white tray and was washed by pouring water over the sample. This was repeated several times.  The whole sample was examined to determine abundances of individual invertebrates and numbers of species.  Aquatic invertebrates were all identified to species with the exception of certain difficult taxa such as oligochaetes, ostracods, copepods and various Diptera larvae and pupae.  A habitat survey of water quality, aquatic vegetation and water body parameters was undertaken.  Measures of aquatic invertebrate diversity were: number of species, bootstrapped number of species and abundance of individuals. ","purpose":"The aim of the surveys was to relate the numbers of invertebrates caught in traps to the habitat around the traps.  This gave an indication of the species that use reedbeds, and the reedbed conditions that favour high biodiversity/ high numbers of rare species/ high numbers of reedbed or wetland specialists species.

These lists were then used to calculate the proportion of tetrads visited in which each species was recorded in the two-hour visit, a figure which was then used as an estimate of relative abundance in the 10-km square.  For the specified count species, the relative abundance index was based on the mean count across surveyed tetrads.  Note that in some remote areas the TTV comprised a single visit of two hours.<br /><br />\r\n2)  Supplementary Records:  In addition to the TTVs records of any other species in the 10-km square were requested.  Observers were particularly asked to look for elusive species such as nocturnal ones which were likely to be missed during TTVs.<br /><br />\r\nIn all cases observers were asked to note whether the species was 'Seen' or 'Breeding' in the 10-km square.  'Seen' was defined as being seen in the breeding season in suitable habitat.'Breeding' was defined by a series of specific activities, for example apparently holding territory, nest found, recent fledglings seen.  A full list of activities considered to be 'Breeding' is in the book (p.4).<br /><br />\r\nIn some cases records from such as Local Bird Reports, seabird colony counts and other surveys were added to the dataset to provide a more complete species list and/or more accurate abundance information for each 10-km square.<br /><br />\r\nFor 10-km squares the dataset records the maximum category of breeding evidence obtained in each 10-km square.  For tetrads the dataset records the species recorded during the TTV.<br /><br />\r\nFor a more comprehensive description of the Methods see <a href=\"http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/birdatlas/previous-atlases/previous-methods\">Second Breeding Atlas Methods</a> and the Introduction to the published book.\r\n","purpose":"To compile as complete a list of breeding species as possible for each 10-km square. <br /><br /> \r\nTo compile a species list for a tetrad in a two-hour time slot (note that this is unlikely to be a complete list of species which occur in the tetrad).\r\n","geographicalCoverage":"All of Britain and Ireland and including, for the original survey although not on currently available through the NBN Gateway, including the Channel Islands.

All data has been collected by volunteer recreational sea anglers.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"The Scottish Shark Tagging Programme","captureMethod":"Data was provided by volunteer sea anglers all using individual baited hooks and line. Bait used depended on the species being targeted. Each fish was either measured (to the nearest cm) at the side of the boat or on board if the necessary equipment is present. We do not encourage anglers to weigh fish directly, instead they use length to weight conversion curves which, while increasing welfare standards, will reduce the accuracy of weight measurement slightly. The fish is then tagged with a unique ID number and relseased unharmed back into the water. The data shown here are only those records that contained a GPS co-ordinate, a known sex and either weight or length. In addition, the dataset also contains records of any re-captures.","purpose":"All data has been collected through an established national tagging programme and registered charity called: The Scottish Shark Tagging Programme.

Furthermore, the data aides with our extensive outrach programmes in schools, community group and at public events.","geographicalCoverage":"The data is focused primarily on the West coast of Scotland from Luce Bay in the south to the Sound of Mull. Effort is focused on good fishing locations through invaluable and accurate local knowledge but this will still introduce some bias.

It is on the Red List of Birds of Conservation Concern in the UK owing to the rapid decline (>50%) in the UK breeding range over the past 25 years, and has been identified as a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.  Full surveys of the breeding cirl bunting population in Britain and the Channel Islands was undertaken in 1989, 1998, 2003, and in 2009 to document potential range expansion. <br><br>\r\nThe 1989 survey was conducted by the RSPB in conjunction with the Devon Bird Watching and Preservation Society.

In an attempt to identify potential range expansion, areas around the core tetrads were also surveyed.  Each tetrad was visited at least twice during the breeding season.  The first visit was made between mid April and the end of May, the second between the beginning of June and the end of August, with a minimum of two weeks between each visit.  Some tetrads were visited four times.  The tetrads were surveyed by walking public rights-of-way and areas of public open space.  Permission to enter private land was sought where necessary.  The tetrad coverage was directly comparable with every cirl bunting survey in southern Britain since 1989.  Locations of any cirl buntings seen or heard were recorded on a map of the tetrad using standard BTO mapping symbols to denote their behaviour and breeding status. <br><br>\r\nThe cirl bunting is a difficult species to detect at very low densities, when song activity may be infrequent. Consequently, there is a possibility that some birds have been missed in tetrads at the edge of the range. The UK population estimate must still be regarded as a minimum as it is likely that concerted search effort allowing unlimited access in the tetrads would pick up more territories.<br><br>\r\nIn order to verify records and validate the dataset, the data have been mapped and thoroughly checked.

The 2007 survey was designed to explore whether the species had continued to decline.\r\n\r\nThe 1995 survey was carried out by the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (IWC) with financial support from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT).

During the 1995 survey, three visits were made to all known and a sample of potential breeding sites. The 2007 survey followed the same approach and each site was visited three times (once within each two-week period of the six-weeks of the survey) and was based on a three-stratum design. Stratum one included lochs for which there have been records of breeding or potentially breeding scoter during the 1995 survey or since. Stratum two consisted of lochs, at which breeding had been recorded historically, but not during the 1995 survey nor since. Stratum three were lochs that were randomly selected from all lochs within 20 km of a stratum one site (as long as the lochs met certain criteria). In addition, there are also some records, which have been allocated to stratum four (sites for which information was available from RSPB Forsinard reserve, and would effectively fall into either stratum 1 or 2). Some records do not have a stratum and this is because they were sites that were visited supplementary to the survey design either by surveyors from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust or by other surveyors.","purpose":"The aim of the 1995 survey was to establish the status and breeding distribution of common scoter in Britain.

Details explaining how populations were derived can be found in the published paper (Summer et al 1999). Crested tits showed a clear preference for Scots Pine both within ancient native pinewoods and other woodlands.

Historically, the Dartford Warbler had a much wider distribution, and was presumably more abundant, than in recent years.  Since the nineteenth century, the population went into steep decline, at least in part due to habitat loss and fragmentation.  The most recent survey in 2006, however, recorded a major expansion in range and population size.  The UK population has been well monitored, with full surveys in 1974, 1984, 1994 and 2006.  The first two surveys were funded by RSPB; the 1994 survey was funded by RSPB and English Nature (now Natural England); the 2006 survey was funded by RSPB, BTO, Natural England and the Forestry Commission (England) under the Statutory Conservation Agencies and RSPB Breeding Bird Scheme (SCARABBS).  \r\n</br>\r\nThough the population in the UK is small compared with that of southern and western France and Spain, the species is considered to be of conservation concern in Europe because of losses in some of the most valuable habitats in Spain, including the Mediterranean maquis.\r\n1974 Survey:  This dataset includes every recorded territory. However, in the New Forest, although 203 pairs were actually found, two large areas thought to support about 40 pairs were not recorded at all and another area was only partially covered. Therefore, the total population count includes an element of estimation. The total population was estimated to be 557 pairs, which was close to the 460 pairs estimated at the last peak in 1960-61. However, the centre of the distribution had moved further west.  The species is very susceptible to cold winters, but the population was high in 1974 after a long run of mild winter weather.  The preferred habitat was mature heather with a generous mixture of gorse of medium height.  Small fragments of heath were found to be less densely occupied than larger ones.  For more information see Bibby & Tubbs (1975), <i>British Birds</i> 68: p177-195.\r\n</br>\r\n1984 Survey: The number of territories recorded in 1984 was 423. The totals recorded in this dataset represent the minimum number of breeding males, taken as equivalent to pairs, which were counted on two or more visits between April and June. Increases in territory numbers were especially noted in Surrey, which had a strong population after recovery from extinction in 1961, and Cornwall was occupied after a 40-year absence.  In the centre of the range, about 10-15% of the population decline is attributed to the fact that colder winters preceded the 1984 survey compared with the mild winters preceding the 1974 survey.  A loss of 75 territories was due to growth of forestry plantations, temporarily suitable in 1974 but by 1984 too old (and permanently unsuitable), and unfortunately not replaced by other new plantings.  The amount of suitable habitat remained about the same in the New Forest, but declined by about 10% in Dorset.  Further losses in Dorset were due to degradation of sites, and the effects of fragmentation and isolation.  For more information, see Robbins & Bibby (1985), <i>British Birds</i> 78: 269-280.\r\n</br>\r\n1994 Survey:  A total of 1,600-1,670 territories was recorded, though it is likely that the actual population was slightly higher (1,800-1,890 territories), representing a near four-fold increase in population since the 1984 survey. Observers were asked to visit each site (or 1km grid square in the New Forest) at least twice, once during April to mid-May and once during mid-May to the end of June. This dataset includes every territory recorded by the observers. The observers recorded the number of singing males and information such as whether the bird was calling or carrying nest material etc. They used this to information to provide their best estimate","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"RSPB","captureMethod":"All surveys were based on visits to all possible known sites where Dartford Warblers had been recorded in the past, or other suitable habitat.  Observers (volunteer ornithologists and RSPB/English Nature/BTO staff) were asked to visit each site or, in 1994 and 2006 1-km square, at least twice, once during April to mid-May, and once during mid-May to the end of June.  They were asked to record the number of singing males and other contacts (for example, calling individuals and adults carrying nesting material or food) separately, to estimate the total number of territories recorded on each visit and to provide their 'best estimate' of the number of territories on that site or 1-km square during the breeding season.  All numeric estimates were cross-referenced to maps showing the locations of bird registrations.  In order to verify records and validate the dataset, the data have been mapped and thoroughly checked.  Geographical checks have included comparing the distribution with that shown in the published paper and ensuring that records with the same area name are located close to each other. \r\n</br>\r\n1974 Survey:  RSPB staff searched all the heathland in Dorset as well as areas of gorsy grassland, old sand pits and forestry plantations.  The New Forest was surveyed by volunteer observers allocated 1-km squares to investigate.  Local volunteer ornithologists in Devon, Isle of Wight, Surrey and Sussex checked most likely sites. \r\n</br>\r\n2006 Survey:  Coverage was based on surveying 1-km grid squares, rather than on a site basis.  The aim was to achieve complete coverage of a set of 'core' squares -- those occupied during the 1994 survey and subsequently -- and to survey a random selection of 'sample' squares from the area around those core squares.  In addition, coverage of 'extra' squares was encouraged in a number of ways. ","purpose":"The stated aim of all four surveys was to assess the population size and range of the Dartford Warbler in Britain.","geographicalCoverage":"In all surveys all sites in England with suitable habitat and known sites where Dartford Warblers had been recorded in the past.  Although Dartford Warblers breed in the Channel Islands, only the 2006 survey covered the islands, although these data cannot at present be shown on the NBN.  The 2006 survey also included some sites in Wales as the species had spread there.\r\nThe 1994 and 2006 datasets include 1-km squares that were surveyed but where no birds were found. These zero records cannot currently be shown on the NBN but are available upon request from the data provider.  All presence records in all surveys represent territory centres of Dartford Warblers.  The full dataset locates these to 100m resolution.\r\n</br>\r\nThe aim in 2006 was to achieve full coverage of all the 1-km squares ('core' squares) occupied during the survey in 1994 and subsequently, together with sample coverage of a random selection of squares from within 5-km and 10-km buffers around these core squares, stratified by the presence of suitable habitat. ","quality":"All data were gathered by trained field workers and the data are of a high quality.  The data have been mapped and checked for sensitivities and typographical/ geographical errors.\r\n</br>\r\n1974 Survey:  Two large areas in the New Forest were not surveyed at all and another area was only partly covered.  Numbers of pairs were estimated for these areas.  The figure for Dorset is probably no more than 90% of the real total.  It is thought unlikely that more than a few pairs nested undetected outside the known range.\r\n</br>\r\n1984 Survey:  The totals recorded represent the minimum numbers of breeding males, taken as equivalent to pairs. We do not know to what extent this might underestimate the truth, but an error greater than 10% is thought unlikely.\r\n</br>\r\n1994 Survey:  Some observers visited sites more than twice, but some sites were only visited once.  This was shown to influence the number of territories found, and corrections have been made to estimates of national totals bearing this in mind.\r\n</br>\r\n2006 Survey:  Not all 1-km squares were visited for an equal number of times.  A survey intensity correction factor has been applied to adjust the population estimate for this.

The Scottish wildcat has been listed as one of 31 species in need of priority action under Scottish Natural Heritage’s Species Action Framework. There is a need to identify the range and population size prior to setting conservation measures. Wildcats meet criterion 1a of the Species Action Framework as a species for conservation action by virtue of its decline in range and abundance over the past 100 years. The results of this survey will help to target suitable management action to be targeted in particular areas. It is a top predator in the British context, and is therefore a species which is likely to increase the profile of species management work and benefits to biodiversity. The Scottish wildcat is a UKBAP Priority Species as part of the Priority Species and Habitats Review. It is included on the Scottish Biodiversity List. It is also listed on Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive.","geographicalCoverage":"Scotland","quality":"Sightings were reported by the general public, with observers varying in their experience of wildcats.

There were a total of 55 interviews, with many recorders having previously submitted information in other forms such as postal questionnaires, leaflets or email responses.

The other species records, collected using non-standard methods, are in a separate survey within this dataset. \r\n\r\nOver half of the potential breeding habitat of Dotterel in Britain was selected for survey using a random sampling technique. Ireland was not included due to the lack of recent breeding records. Two methods were used to estimate the population size, with an agreed best estimate of 630 breeding males (Whitfield, 2002). The number of pairs estimated in Whitfield (2002), were derived from an analysis of these raw data. \r\n\r\nThe national population estimate was significantly higher in 1987/88 (estimated to be 840 breeding pairs), but numbers were probably greatest in 1989 and declined in the 1990s. The change in numbers may be due to influences away from the breeding grounds or a redistribution of birds away from Scotland to breeding sites elsewhere in the Palaearctic. \r\n\r\nThis survey revealed that the population had contracted and the majority of the birds (almost 93% of the population) were breeding in three regions in Scotland: the central and east regions and in the north Highlands. \r\n\r\nThis survey was carried out under the Statutory Conservation Agencies and RSPB Breeding Birds Scheme (SCARABBS) partnership.

Surveyors walked within at least 100m of every point on each site once during the period when most male dotterel attend chicks and are more visible before chicks fledge (typically 20th June - 18th July). The male provides most parental care and are most visible before chicks fledge.

Three surveyors carried out the vegetation recording with an additional three contracts let externally. After initial inspections of the sites, the surveyors divided the vegetation types into apparently homogeneous stands. Within each stand type, sample \nareas were chosen and the vegetation type recorded from inside a 2-metre x 2-metre quadrat.

Over 40,000 surveys have been distributed to schools and members of the public.\r\n\r\nAccuracy of the complete survey methodology is included the Data Quality Assessment Report that highlights analytical work done to understand the data, and to identify various levels of confidence in the data. This report is available from http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/opalsoil. This procedure was adopted to clean the data from unreliable data before analysis of trends and patterns was undertaken. The report should be referred to for further details. ","purpose":"The records were collected as part of a national survey of earthworm species and associated soil conditions in England as part of a National Lottery funded project (OPAL). The project involved the use of members of the public to perform the survey and record observations and earthworms found, and the records were subsequently uploaded to a web-based gateway and compiled automatically into a database.","geographicalCoverage":"The survey data covers England only. \r\n\r\nComplete high resolution coverage of England has not yet been achieved, and work is ongoing to identify and target areas of low survey submissions. \r\n\r\nAccuracy of the data is to within a few meters of the actual location where surveys have been carried out. This has been possible through the use of a specially developed tool that uses Google Maps to allow participants to identify their survey site by zooming in to high resolution levels and placing an electronic marker at their survey site. ","quality":"The data forms a new record set for this subset of species. Prior to this there is no known national database for earthworm distributions. Also, species identification has been performed by members of the public using simple hand held card-like magnifiers. This has not allowed a high level of accuracy in species identification, although the identification of functional groups has shown a higher confidence level. The data quality report (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/opalsoil) contains further details on this including comparative accuracy levels between adults and children. Earthworm identification courses have been run at many locations across the country to increase the quality of species identification.

The points were used to select polygons from a range of sources, including SSSI and manual digitising, in which there was some degree of confidence that fen habitat was present. A policy of inclusion was employed due to the uncertainty of some polygons. Initial tests of FenBASE demonstrated some references were inaccurate, therefore a polygon was only captured where the name of the FenBASE site matched the name of the SSSI or, in the absence of a SSSI, where a place name and symbology on an OS 10K raster backdrop was concurrent with FenBASE site name.</br>A detailed polygon coverage of the West Midlands and Lancashire was also available from a pilot study commissioned by Natural England, and the relevant fen habitat polygons were lifted directly from this and placed into the new inventory layer. </br>Where aerial photography coverage was available, it was used to give an estimate of non-fen habitat land cover within a polygon. Polygons whose surface area exceeded 100ha were examined more closely with aerial photography. Areas thought not to be fen habitat were removed. The removed areas mainly consisted of agricultural / industrial land and open water.</br>Overall, fen habitat itself proved difficult to identify using aerial photography. </br>In total 12,164 polygons were captured, covering approximately 83,625ha. </br>Polygons have either been lifted from SSSI unit, SSSI, Natural England Wetland Habitat Pilot Project work, extracted from OS Landline or have been digitised from OS 10K raster tiles.  Or supplied by Local Record Centres from across England.</br>Although the minimum mappable unit for this project was initially 0.25ha, some polygons remain in the GIS layer below this size. This is because small sites were common and clearly made a significant contribution to the inventory, particularly as many of these had a high confidence of containing fen habitat. </br>Attributes for each polygon include confidence: in a polygon being fen habitat; mappable habitat definition version; data sources and percentage area estimates of other habitats in the polygon where aerial photography allowed.</br>The data was compiled and captured using ArcView 9.2 and the Exegesis data capture tool supplied by Natural England. This tool is designed to provide a degree of automation to the attribution process.

Bullhead populations were also recorded as part of the Dee Stock Assessment Programme on a selection of sites in 2004 and as part of work on the Eel Monitoring Programme at 3 sites in the Dee Catchment for 2004.\r\n\r\nAll sites were surveyed using the electric fishing equipment in accordance with protocols described in the Environment Agency - Electric Fishing Theory and Practice Manual (1988). Two methodologies were employed either quantitative temporal data for sites surveyed annually or semi-quantitative spatial data for sites surveyed every 5 years. Three fishing runs were used for quantitative surveys and one for semi-quantitative surveys.","purpose":"The purpose of this data capture was to monitor bullhead populations to assess whether Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) management adequately protects that species.","geographicalCoverage":"Wales - Rivers Dee, Usk and Wye.","quality":"High confidence.","additionalInformation":"Contact: Natural Resources Wales, Ty Cambria, 29 Newport Road, Cardiff, CF24 0TP\r\n Tel: 0300 065 3000\r\n Fax: 0300 065 3001\r\n enquiries@naturalresourceswales.gov.uk\r\n http://www.naturalresourceswales.gov.uk","accessConstraints":"There are no access restrictions to this data.

In most cases the data arises from bottle trapping, torchlight searches, and/or egg counts carried out by professional surveyors to standards approved by English Nature in EPSL licence application and accepted by the licensing authority.\r\nb) The record has arisen from verifiable direct observation by a competent observer.\r\nc)  The record relates to data in the rECOrd data base (the biological recording centre for Cheshire) on positive identifications from museum records, voluntary contributors, the literature etc. (contact rECOrdfor further clarification) to which suitable spatial references (i.e. OS NGR, Lat. Long. Coordinates, can be assigned). In the case of the rECOrd data, and other data deerived from similar sources, precisely accurate location of the waterbody cannot be guaranteed, as the locational data provided to rECOrd by the originators of the data may be of variable quality. Every attempt at precise identification is and will continue to be made in this respect, but users should bear this caveat in mind.\r\n","purpose":"Purposes of the original data capture include pre-development survey, support of application for protected species licences in respect of disturbance of the species or its habitat, preparatory survey in advance of infrastructure development e.g. potential road or pipeline corridors, baseline or site monitoring survey relating to protected sites such Local or National Nature reserves, SSSI's etc., biological records collected by interested individuals or groups such as local wildlife trusts etc., scientific or educational research activity.","geographicalCoverage":"The Geographical extent of the data set is the Vice-County of Cheshire i.e. Cheshire County and neighbouring unitary authorities (Chester City, Ellesmere Port and Neston UA, Wirral UA, Crewe and Nantwich, Congleton, Vale Royal, Halton and Widnes UA). The dataset records are uneven, reflecting the distribution of suitable water bodies in the region, the bias in survey towards areas where records are derived from survey prior to development, and reflect both general survey effort and our access to records. The majority of original records have 6 figure or higher levels of precision, with many originally presented as 12 figure references, presumably GPS derived. The usual caveats regarding the accuracy of such precise grid references and GPS should be born in mind by users.","quality":"Data derived from competent ecological survey (Protected Species licence documentation, scientific survey with verifiable methodology such as the PondLife Survey) may be treated with confidence subject to caveats noted in this document. Other and older data (for example pre- 1981, before the WCA and later establishment of licensing requirements relating to survey methodology) should generally be treated with more caution. However, the species is distinctive, there have been no significant taxonomic changes and wherever possible records included are from verifiably reliable sources, consequently it can reasonably assumed that misidentification of the species is unlikely and inaccuracies will tend more towards false absence rather than false presence. Errors should be assumed to be ours, and the Inventory would appreciate any and all being drawn to our attention for correction.

","temporalCoverage":"Recording effort and survey time vary. Some records represent incidental, chance encounters, sometimes outside the optimal survey period, particularly in the case of records in terrestrial foraging habitat, refugia etc (such records may appear in the Comments field associated with a site, where they occur in close proximity). Where this is the case, precise dates and other details of the survey/sighting may be recorded. In the majority of cases, records were originally derived from professionally executed ecological survey, details of which e.g. period of survey activity, method (i.e. bottle trapping, torching, hand search etc.) are recorded and almost always made available. Where a location is recorded in two or more surveys, each are included in the inventory with a unique reference for the site (SITEKEY) and record (RECORDKEY).\r\n\r\nMany records exist regarding breeding locations/occurrence where either or both terrestrial and aquatic habitat have now disappeared due to development, changes in agricultural practice, succession or some other unknown cause. These records are generally not included in the inventory but are available from rECOrd, the biological recording body for the Cheshire area, and may be used in conjunction with the inventory for studies regarding changes in the distribution either of recorded breeding locations or suitable aquatic habitat for the species. These records will be presented as GIS coverages in future.\r\nSurvey effort is not consistent over time, but reflects the change in the legal status of the species following the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, most noticeably subsequent to periods of change in rate of development activity, major engineering projects such as pipeline, power line or road construction. There have also been periods of heightened scientific survey activity, such as the 1995-1998 Pond Life Project Surveys. From 1990 the vast majority of records have a date (DD/MM/YYYY) at least referring to the first day of the first month of survey to the last of the last month of survey. Occasionally, and for many records pre-1990, dates are only available for year, when they are recorded as 1st January to 30th December (Startdate and Enddate).

Greenshank (Tringa nebularia) are sensitive to human land use activities such as aforestation and their breeding range is thought to have contracted, with an associated decline in breeding numbers, since 1980.  However, Greenshank numbers in the Outer Hebrides are thought to have increased considerably, with breeding being confirmed on the Shetland islands for the first time in 1980.  Despite the extensive study of the Greenshank breeding behaviour this was the first ever national survey of this species.  The survey was funded by the RSPB, JNCC and SNH through the Statutory Conservation Agencies RSPB Annual Breeding Birds Scheme (SCARABBS) programme.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"RSPB","captureMethod":"The breeding range of the Greenshank was defined using records from the 1968-72 and 88-91 breeding birds atlases and additional records from 1968-94 from SSDB (sensitive species database).  Evidence for breeding was noted in 332 10-km squares and this formed the breeding range for Greenshanks.  The squares were then stratified into high and low categories using abundance data, the 10-km were split into 5-km squares giving a total of 348 and 980 in the high and low stratum respectively.  49 low and 52 high stratum squares were then selected at random to give a sampling intensity for the whole range of around 8%.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEach 5km square was sampled first between the 10th April and the 25 May and then again between 26 May and 10 July.  The dates were chosen as a compromise between the typical arrival time and departure time of Greenshanks to their territories.  Surveys took place at any time before 18.00GMT and were not undertaken during times of low visibility, high wind or continuous rain.

As the recording scheme is quite small, with few contributors modern records are generated on a rather ad-hoc basis.  Methods used in data capture include direct observations underground, trawl nets in pit wells, bait traps, the Gilson well samplers, drift nets for sampling springs and the Bou-Rouch and Karaman-Chappuis methods for sampling the hyporheic zone and springs.  Full details of sampling methodologies are included on the scheme website.  <br /><br />\r\nRecords are included on the database if they are from a known contributor or a specimen is sent to the scheme organiser for validation. A very few old records are thought to be possible mis-identifications and have been corrected and included in the dataset, details of any concern are included in the Notes section. Some records have been generated from literature searches and references are also included in the Notes section.","purpose":"The recording scheme is very small and was originally started when the results of survey work to identify the distribution of <i>Niphargus glenniei</i> within Devon became amalgamated with data already held by BRC.  The project then expanded to look at the national distributions of all British hypogean macro-Crustacea.  Some records (mostly <i>Niphargus aquilex</i>) were supplied from the Environment Agency's database BIOSYS and were collected during the routine biological assessment of river water quality.  Much of the older records held by BRC were derived from the biological records of the British Cave Research Association and its predecessor the Cave Research Group.  These were begun as ad- hoc records of the biota of British caves and were published in 16 parts by Mary Hazelton between 1955 and 1978.","geographicalCoverage":"The dataset covers the whole of the UK (including the Channel Islands) and Ireland, although in the UK the distribution of the hypogean Crustacea is mostly limited to the south of England and Wales (as far north as County Sligo in Ireland).  This is thought to be a relic from the last glaciation.  <i>Antrobathynella</i> has been recorded as far north as the Midlandian Valley in Scotland and occasional records exist for <i>Niphargus aquilex</i> north of the glacial limit.  <br /><br />\r\nMost of the cave systems of the UK have been fairly well covered by the CRG and BCRA recording in the past, which also included some wells and mines.  More work is required in North Wales, the Yorkshire Wolds and East Anglia especially.  Due to a small number of recorders and difficulties in accessing the habitats in which hypogean Crustacea occur the range of the dataset has limitations.  Most modern records reflect the recorders' areas of activity.  A few very old records for the Channel Islands exist and a, modern, detailed survey is required.  Extensive work has recently been carried out and is still on-going in Ireland. <br /><br />\r\nMost records have eight or six figure grid references, although a few of the older records are limited to 1km or 10km grid references.","quality":"The dataset has been maintained on an ad-hoc basis since its first creation in 2003.  An extensive review of the dataset and up-dating of records was carried out in early 2007.  In early 2008 an attempt was made to try and match some of the older records with more accurate dates and grid references (especially the Irish records) by re-checking literature sources and examination of Ordnance Survey maps. <br /><br />\r\nAs the dataset only covers a small group of species, a fairly high level of confidence can be attached to the accuracy of the identifications, especially since certain <i>Niphargus</i> species tend to occur in certain areas / habitats and any confusing records have since been checked.  There are a few old records for <i>N. aquilex</i> from South wales on the BCRA database which are thought to have been mis-identified N. fontanus and there is some doubt over the correct identification of a record of Crangonyx subterraneus from Montgomeryshire sent in by the Environment Agency.  Any doubts over the data have been explained in the Notes section of the database.","additionalInformation":"Website for the hypogean Crustacea recording scheme, hosted by the FBA at <a href=\"www.freshwaterlife.org/hcrs\">www.freshwaterlife.org/hcrs</a> The dataset can be downloaded as an Excel file.

The true habitat of most of the Hypogean Crustacae is in water-filled subterranean rock strata and populations in caves, wells and boreholes etc are often of an ephemeral nature.  For this reason it was thought that there would be no requirement for any constraints on data access.\r\n\r\n<i>Niphargus glenniei</i> has recently been added to the UK BAP list but it is likely that it is widespread throughout Devon and probably Cornwall too and so would not be threatened by knowledge of where it has been recorded in the past.","useConstraints":"None","temporalCoverage":"Sporadic recording of the hypogean Crustacea began in the late 19th century, when many of the species were first discovered.  From the late 1930s onward the Cave Research Group began to co-ordinate efforts to look at the biota of British caves.  This was mainly carried out be A. Glennie who carried out most of the sampling and M. Hazelton who published the results.  Most of the survey work concentrated on caves, although mines and wells were also sampled.  This work was mostly concentrated in the 50s and 60s.  T. Gledhill of the FBA carried out more survey work during the 80s.  The BCRA cave records were computerized, validated and analysed at the BRC in 1986 for the then Nature Conservancy Council.  This primarily concentrated on the hypogean amphipods.  In 1988 this work was updated and expanded to include <i>Bathynella</i> sp.,  <i>Proasellus</i> and several other non-aquatic cave taxa. There was then a lull in activity until the late 90s when L. Knight began to look at the distribution of <i>N. glenniei</i> in Devon and began to send records in to the BRC and was subsequently asked to begin a recording scheme. An appeal to various Environment Agency areas and the then IFE produced more records of <i>N. aquilex</i> in samples of riverine benthic invertebrate fauna.   <br /><br />\r\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest by several other researchers, including Paul Wood of Loughborough University and Graham Proudlove of the BCRA.   A review of the status and distribution of the subterranean aquatic Crustacea of Britain and Ireland was published by Proudlove et. al. in 2003 which also included the micro-Crustacea (Ostracods, Cladocera & Copepoda). Recent recording has mostly been on an ad-hoc basis with occasional cave, well and hyporheic records provided by Knight as well as targeted survey work in certain areas, including West Cornwall, where <i>N. glenniei</i> was first discovered outside of Devon and the Devon / Somerset / Dorset border area.  Wood has carried out recent important work on the Little Stour River in Kent.  Three Valleys Water staff produced some interesting results from the sampling of boreholes in their area. Tim Johns of the Environment Agency has also begun to provide occasional records from the sampling of boreholes and provided further records of <i>N. aquilex</i> from the BIOSYS database.  <br /><br />\r\nJ. Arnscheidt of the University of Ulster, along with support form Wood has been carrying out extensive survey work on wells and boreholes in Ireland which has led to the discovery of Microniphargus in County Cork.  This project is on-going and will be a systematic survey of the whole of Ireland.  Knight has also recently carried out extensive survey work on caves and springs in Ireland which encompassed most of the country up to Fermanagh.  This has expanded the known distribution of <i>N. wexfordensis</i> outside of County Wexford (now also known to occur in caves as well as groundwater) and provided a second record of <i>Microniphargus</i>.<br /><br />\r\nWith assistance from M. Fletcher and S. Pawley of the FBA Recorders & Schemes project a website for the recording scheme has recently been set up.<br /><br />\r\nA. Robertson of the University of Roehampton (with support from Wood and Knight) has recently been awarded funding from the Esmee-Fairburn Foundation for survey work on <i>N. glenniei</i> and on the hyporheos in South Wales which will commence in 2009.<br /><br />\r\nWhere possible most records have full dates, although some of the older records are limited to year only, especially where some of these records have arisen from literature searches of very old publications.","updateFrequency":"unknown","dateUploaded":1413537362953,"metadataLastEdited":1413537362953,"formattedDateUploaded":"17-Oct-2014","formattedMetadataLastEdited":"17-Oct-2014","organisationID":117,"conditionsAccepted":false},{"href":"https://data.nbn.org.uk/Datasets/GA000781","organisationHref":"https://data.nbn.org.uk/api/organisations/31","key":"GA000781","title":"Ickworth Estate species data held by The National Trust","description":"The Ickworth Estate (723 ha) has been owned by The National Trust since 1956.

The ISA process integrates surveys for both purposes, so where they co-occur they are usually recorded together. Individual surveys include the recording of a variety of species within SSSI Units and/or Rural Land Register Parcels, as well as other non-biotic measurements such as vegetation structure, which together are used in the assessment of SSSI feature condition, Indicators of Success, or both. Species records are associated with the SSSI units and/or RLR Parcels containing the list of features which are the subject of each part of the ISA survey, so survey 'feature lists' are used to define discrete geographic areas within which the species were recorded. Precise BNG grid references, or eastings and northings, are not recorded  for individual species, and the precise extent of the features (usually semi-natual habitats) within the SSSI units and/or RLR parcels is unknown. Each species record is provided with additional attribute information including the list of features assessed, the variable and summary value.

Only species that were actually seen are included - there are no 'absence' records.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"Natural England","captureMethod":"The species records were extracted from Natural England's ISAT (Integrated Site Assessment Tool) database.

Natural England maintains a comprehensive set of instructions for surveyors, provides training and support to surveyors, and undertakes internal quality assurance to ensure surveys meet our published Evidence Standard.","purpose":"Integrated Site Assessments are undertaken to assess the condition of Site of Special Scientific Interest notified features, Indicators of Success on Higher Level Stewardship agri-environment schemes, or both, in England.

Vegetation structural characteristics, for example, combine with indicators of good or poor habitat condition to generate a condition assessment, using Common Standards Monitoring guidance and approaches. It is also important to understand that these species records cannot be accurately georeferenced to specific point locations.

","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"Derbyshire Wildlife Trust","captureMethod":"Records forming the dataset have arisen from a variety of sources. These include local naturalists specialising in recording Lepidoptera, DWT staff and volunteers, and members of the general public. \r\n<br></br>\r\nFor a very small number of sites the data is the result of repeated surveys specifically for Lepidoptera within those sites over varying periods of time, using techniques such as light trapping. However, the majority of the records are incidental records made during other survey work or ad-hoc records provided by members of the public. ","purpose":"Most of the records have been captured as incidental records and as such provide additional information regarding the biodiversity interest within sites and help to contribute to current knowledge regarding species distributions within Derbyshire.  ","geographicalCoverage":"The data relates to the administrative county of Derbyshire. Approximately 90% of the records are site specific, with most of these sites being Derbyshire Wildlife Trust Reserves, or sites which are designated Local Wildlife Sites. As the Local Wildlife Sites system does not currently operate within the Peak District National Park (PDNP) many of the records are from outside of the National Park, the exception being those which relate to  Trust Reserves within the PDNP. \r\n<br></br>\r\nBecause the records are mainly site based, most have been entered onto the Trust's database using a centroid grid reference for the site. This has resulted in approximately 90% of the records having a precision of 8 or 6 figure grid references. With some sites spanning more than 1 tetrad, and more rarely 1 hectad, some records will invariably have been assigned to an incorrect tetrad or hectad. ","quality":"The data has been scrutinised by Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Entomological Society as part of a validation process. This has resulted in the correction of obvious input errors  (after reference to the primary data source) and highlighted where records required additional information in order to have a high confidence in their accuracy (for example, species where genitalia examination is needed for accurate identification). \r\n<br></br>\r\nAny records with a low level of confidence remaining after validation procedures have been excluded. It is expected that following additional validation checks some of the excluded records will be incorporated in future updates of this dataset. \r\n<br></br>\r\nGiven the validation procedures and cautionary approach which has been adopted it is considered that there is a reasonable level of confidence in the accuracy of the dataset but the above comments regarding the precision of the records should be particularly borne  in mind when using this dataset.","additionalInformation":"Additional information about the data can be obtained from Derbyshire Wildlife Trust at enquiries@derbyshirewt.co.uk or 01773 881188. Please note that the Trust is currently unable to provide detailed interpretative support.  ","accessConstraints":"Access to this dataset is restricted for the following  reasons. \r\n<br></br>\r\nAdverse affect upon the Data Provider:\r\nDisclosure of full record information would adversely affect the interests of the person who provided the information. The provider is not under any legal obligation to supply the information to the public through the NBN Gateway and has not consented to its wider release. \r\n<br></br>\r\nFull disclosure would adversely affect the relationship between Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and the large number of landowners who kindly consent access to their sites for survey work to be undertaken. Many sites have no public access and wider release of detailed information for records and their location could potentially lead to unauthorised access being directly attributable to the release of data collected during site surveys. This could result in withdrawal of permissions for access in the future and jeopardise the Trust's relationship with landowners.

In order to learn more about the full range of species using Lothian gardens 16 of the 170 gardens were chosen for special studies by the Information Centre team. The study gardens were carefully selected to cover the full range of local garden types i.e. rural-urban, high-low altitude and large-small size. The Centre team visited each of the 16 gardens six times over the 18 month study period and on each occasion collected a wide range of invertebrate and lower plant specimens and recorded the vascular plants.

A Habitat Data Capture Tool was also supplied to the contractors and used to attribute new or modified sites by habitat and degree of confidence in interpretation and mapping. </br> On the basis of evaluated data, sites were added or removed from the inventories, or amended.  Sites were removed where they no longer existed as vegetated habitat, i.e. having being developed, or due to strong evidence that grassland of priority habitat quality was no longer present.  Sites on the existing inventories were modified in terms of boundaries and/ or description based on more recent or comprehensive data.  Sites were added where supporting data met the required criteria for confidence and was comprehensive enough to establish presence of priority habitat or good quality semi-improved grassland (GQSIG), i.e. on the basis of the process undertaken to assess data and map sites.  <a href=\"http://www.jncc.gov.uk/docs/NBN_LowlandGrasslandInventoryMetadata_England.doc\">Further information.</a>","purpose":"The original grassland inventories were developed during the mid 1990s to document the known localities of good quality species rich lowland grassland of nature conservation value in each English county.

Phase 2 involved the production of database files containing detailed biological, chemical and locational data. Phase 3 examines the extent of contamination from offshore E and P activities and impacts on the biota, and will attempt to determine any large-scale trends over wider geographical areas.

Within this area, two sampling strategies were used to generate the population estimate. Firstly, in some regions Raptor Study Groups (RSGs) and Upland Bird Study Groups (UBSGs) provided complete census coverage of many 10 km squares by checking all known historical sites for occupation. Secondly, in the remainder of the breeding distribution, a random subset of 10 km squares were selected and surveyed intensively by RSPB fieldworkers. The remainder of the squares were not surveyed at all, and then, following the standardised approach used in the previous national merlin survey (1993-94), an extrapolated population estimate was determined for those areas with no census coverage. Strict survey guidelines, identical to those used in the previous national survey (1993-94), were followed. RSPB fieldworkers visited the randomly selected 10 km grid squares on four occasions during the survey period (1st April - 31st July), once in each month (April, May, June and July). Fieldworkers passed within 500 m of all suitable merlin habitat and were advised to employ a combination of both searching and watching from vantage points to determine the presence of merlin.

Numbers and range have declined in Britain over the greater part of the 20th century, but have begun increasing again since the start of the 21st.  The species breeds mainly in southern England, but there are scattered populations as far north as central Scotland.  \r\nThe 1981 national survey located 1784 calling males and estimated the maximum population to be 2100 calling males.  (The dataset though only has 1642 birds, the other 142 not having sufficient location information to be mapped.)  This was a lower total number than expected.  The distribution also showed a contraction of the species? range in the north and west (compared to the 1968-1972 Breeding Atlas).  The main cause of the decline was probably a change in climate leading to reduced breeding success, but habitat destruction and disturbance were likely also involved.  Information obtained on habitats showed that conifer plantations had become the major habitat type; followed by lowland heath, open bracken areas, other woodlands and raised bogs or mosses.  For more information, see Gribble (1983), <i>Bird Study</i> 30: 165-176.\r\nThe 1992 survey (organised by BTO and RSPB) located 3093 males and indicated that numbers had increased to an estimated 3400.  (The dataset though only has 3082 birds, the other 11 not having sufficient location information to be mapped.)  This represented an increase of more than 50% since 1981.  For more information, see Morris et al. (1994), <i>Bird Study</i> 41: 181-191.\r\nThe 2004 survey (organised by BTO, RSPB, Natural England, Forestry Commission England, Wales and Scotland) located 4131 males and estimated that the total had risen again to 4606 males (+36% since 1992).  (The dataset contains a total of 4197 territory records, comprising 3083 territorial males (10 without location information), six single females, 18 unsexed adults and 46 presumed migrant males ? only noted in May.)  National Biodiversity Action Plan objectives for Nightjar conservation were reached in respect of population size and stability, but the target for a 5% range increase by 2003 was not met. (NOTE: In 2005, a further 192 territorial males and 3 unsexed individuals were located in locations (New Forest, Dorset Heaths and East Anglia) not covered during the 2004 survey.  However, up to 7 territories may be represented in both the 2004 and 2005 datasets.)","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"British Trust for Ornithology","captureMethod":"1981 Survey:  The unit for survey coverage was the 10-km square.  Observers were asked to look first at known or formerly occupied sites, and then to investigate other potentially suitable habitats within each square, particularly new forestry or felled and restock areas.  For each site observers recorded a site name, six-figure grid reference, area and altitude, visit dates and numbers of calling males located, and a standardized habitat description.  A minimum of two visits per site was recommended, ideally in June and July, at the optimum times for locating calling males. \r\n</br>\r\n1992 Survey:  All sites known to have been occupied recently, all formerly occupied sites where suitable habitat might remain, and potential new sites were visited.  Sites ranged from small woodland clearings (clearly defined by surrounding mature trees), to vast expanses of open heath.  Remote upland conifer plantations were randomly sampled from 10-km squares known to have been recently occupied.  Observers were asked to make at least two visits to each site, and where possible to make at least one of these during June, the peak time for calling.  The number of males seen or heard on each occasion was recorded on a standard card, and observers were asked to mark the position of each bird located on each visit on a 1:10000 map.  \r\n</br>\r\n2004  Survey:  Survey coverage units were 1-km squares.  As previously all sites known to have been occupied recently were mapped as were formerly occupied sites where suitable habitat might remain and specific sample squares were chosen on a hierarchical basis according to three levels of priority: high (sites occupied since 1992 and a random sample of 500 1-km squares containing suitable habitat within 100-km of known sites), medium (a sample of sites occupied in 1981 and area of potential future Special Protection Areas extension or designation), and low (a sample of sites with suitable habitat but no history of occupancy and additional sites which observers considered to contain suitable habitat).  The strategy was to cover all high priority sites and to sample 100-km buffer zones around these (to detect local range expansion).  Further a random sample of areas of potentially suitable habitat, with no recent record of occupancy, was also made.  Two visits to allocated 1-km squares were made between late May and mid July.  Each surveyor recorded the locations of all individual registrations (observations of individuals) from all visits and casual records.  These were plotted in GIS to determine individual territories, whilst accounting for duplicated observations from adjacent recording areas or additional visits.  Observers also noted the occurrence of habitat categories within 50m of each Nightjar registration.\r\nIn all cases trained volunteers carried out most of the surveys. \r\nPlease note that in the additional attributes field 'Territory', 'may only male' refers to suspected migrants, the majority of which were not occupying breeding sites.","purpose":"The stated aim of each survey was to assess the population size and range of the Nightjar and to gather information on its use of different habitat types.","geographicalCoverage":"The stated aim for each survey was to survey the entire UK population of the species.  However the actual coverage in each case did not reach this ideal.\r\n1981 Survey:  241 10-km squares in Britain were surveyed.

LWIC developed a system for extracting the data from these files into excel format that could be imported to the Recorder 6 database.

Each SAC was sampled with survey lengths of 600m along riparian habitat. The sampling protocol within each SAC followed Brewer et al. (2002) in that two 600m sites per 10km square were sampled. A total of 291 sites were surveyed in 44 SACs. Where possible, the same 2003-04 sample points were used in the 2011-12 survey, and where possible each SAC was surveyed in the same month as in the 2003-04 survey. Using GIS, an additional 73 sites in 36 10km squares were randomly selected from the available suite of sites surveyed in the previous otter surveys to provide comparative data.\r\n\r\nThe current standard for otter SCM is to count spraints and other evidence along a 600m stretch of one river bank. Brewer et al. (2002) recommended that a fixed distance of 100m is searched for all signs of otter activity, and that if no spraints are found then a further search of up to 600m should be conducted in order to ascertain a^??presencea^?? over a longer stretch of watercourse. This protocol was followed, with the first 100m section recorded separately and nested within the 600m data to give greater potential for comparison with previous surveys. The presence of mink and water vole was also recorded.","purpose":"The aim of this survey was to replicate the site SCM element of the 2003-04 national survey with the following three objectives:  to undertake essential second cycle Site Condition Monitoring on all 44 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in Scotland where otters are identified as a qualifying feature; to provide data on the wider countryside as a broad comparison to SACs and to use the extensive geographical coverage of the combined SAC and wider countryside data to provide an assessment of the overall conservation status of otters throughout Scotland since the first national survey of 1977-79.","geographicalCoverage":"The SACs are spread geographically throughout Scotland.","quality":"There is a high degree of confidence - all signs were noted by experienced surveyors.

The survey was carried out in the 1996 breeding season covering 63 saltmarsh sites. This survey highlighted that saltmarshes support c.45% of the national population of redshank breeding in Britain. Since a previous survey carried out in 1985, there has been a 22.9% decline of redshank breeding on saltmarshes. The decline is thought to be caused by an increase in grazing pressure of saltmarshes, it was therefore suggested that mitigation procedures such as habitat creation and changes in agricultural management measures were required.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis survey was carried out and funded by the RSPB. \r\n","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"RSPB","captureMethod":"In this survey a total of 63 saltmarsh sites in Britain were surveyed for breeding redshsank.

The mean number of redshank counted on survey visits up to 31 May was used as an estimate of the peak number of pairs with nests.

","typeName":"Habitat","organisationName":"Natural England","captureMethod":"The inventory was originally compiled at the Environment Agency’s National Centre for Environmental Data and Surveillance (NCEDS) in Bath, under a partnership English Nature, who also supplied data sets essential to the project. </br>The data is based mainly on RSPB Reedbed Inventory, a point based inventory of Reedbed habitat location. The points were used to select polygons from a range of sources, including SSSI and manual digitising, in which there was some degree of confidence that Reedbed habitat was present. A policy of inclusion was employed due to the uncertainty of some polygons. Initial tests of RSPB Reedbed Inventory demonstrated some references were inaccurate, therefore a polygon was only captured where the name of the RSPB Reedbed Inventory site matched the name of the SSSI or, in the absence of a SSSI, where a place-name and symbology on an OS 10K raster backdrop was concurrent with RSPB Reedbed Inventory site name.</br>A detailed polygon coverage of the West Midlands and Lancashire was also available from a pilot study commissioned by English Nature, and the relevant Reedbed habitat polygons were lifted directly from this and placed into the new inventory layer.</br>Where aerial photography coverage was available, it was used to give an estimate of non-Reedbed habitat land cover within a polygon. Polygons whose surface area exceeded 100ha were examined more closely with aerial photography. Areas thought not to be reedbed habitat were removed. The removed areas mainly consisted of agricultural / industrial land.</br>Overall reedbed habitat itself proved difficult to identify using aerial photography.</br>It has since been updated by a variety of contractors and local record centres, they included:</br><u>East Midlands: Completed by Just Ecology in November 2010</u><br>Surveys and datasets include:</br><ul><li>Derbyshire Wildlife Trust BAP habitats</li><li>Leicestershire and Rutland Environmental Records Centre data: Local Wildlife Site Register, Floodplain wetland Inventory, North-West Leicestershire Phase 1 Habitat survey</li><li>Lincolnshire Biodiversity Partnership BAP habitats</li><li>Northamptonshire Wildlife Trust - BAP Habitats 2010 LWS Survey</li><li>Nottinghamshire Biological and Geological Record Centre - LBAP Habitats Mapping</li><li>Peak District data:  BAP database, FEP database </li><li>National Trust Habitats Database</li><li>National Forest Phase 1 layer</li></ul></br><u>North West Region: Completed by Jerram Rigby Ecological Consultants in April 2010</u><br><ul><li>FenBASE</li><li>Phase 1 Habitat Survey</li><li>Natural England’s SSSI NVC or other Phase 2</li><li>County Wildlife Survey</li><li>The Cumbria Wildlife Trust and Environment Agency Reedbed Mapping Project for Cumbria.</li></ul></br><u>North East Region: Completed by Just Ecology in February 2009</u></br>Additional datasets used for the update of the reedbed inventories were:</br><ul><li>Brenkley Meadows SSSI NVC data*;</li><li>Clara Vale & Ryton NVC data*;</li><li>Durham Magnesian Limestone Fen Inventory*;</li><li>Northumberland Biodiversity Partnership habitat data; </li><li>Widdybank Fell NVC data*;</li><li>Forestry Commission Border Mires data*;</li><li>North Pennines AONB Partnership 'Hay Time' project data*;</li><li>Farm Environment Plan data; </li><li>Paper files from: Grassland Inventory survey; Northumberland Ecological Services survey; Northumberland Grassland Survey; Pegwhistle Burn Fen survey; SE Northumberland Phase 1 grassland survey; Potland Burn NVC survey; SNCI NVC surveys; SNCI surveys; SSSI NVC surveys; SSSI surveys; </li><li>Field survey data from this project.</li></ul></br>Those datasets marked with a * were existing GIS datasets that could be processed semi-automatically.

(1999).\r\n\r\nThe data held in the RMD are the result of collaborative work across all four statutory nature conservation bodies: Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Natural England (NE), Natural Resources Wales (NRW, formerly CCW) and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA).","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"Joint Nature Conservation Committee","captureMethod":"The macrophyte survey method records aquatic and marginal plants in a 500m long survey section of river. Species from the river channel and the margins/base of the bank are recorded separately on a three-point scale of relative abundance and percentage cover. A standard check-list of species is used to aid recording. The field data can be used to classify the plant community as described by Holmes et al. (1999), and the database has a facility that allows keying-out of the community to sub-type level. This plant community classification has been used as the basis of river SSSI selection. The database also holds a small amount of invertebrate and fish data.\r\n\r\nThe grid reference of the species observation is the lower grid reference of the river section (the upper grid reference included as an attribute) and the precision of the record provided reflects this lower grid reference rather than the 500m long survey section.","purpose":"These records were collated following the first comprehensive national survey of macrophytes in rivers throughout Britain.

The collection of data allowed a comprehensive national rivers classification (based upon macrophytes) to be developed.  The latest version of this classification system is published in, a^??Holmes, N.T, Boon, P.J. & Rowell, T.A., (1999), Vegetation communities of British rivers - a revised classificationa^??, and is available online at: http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2619.","geographicalCoverage":"UK","quality":"Confidence in the data = high.

Surveyors fished over patches of suitable habitat for 5 minutes using smooth DC. Lamprey ammocoetes and transformers attracted from the substrate were captured in dip nets.

This defines optimal habitat as stable, fine sediment (silt/sand) to a depth of 15 cm or more, in slow flowing well oxygenated water, often with fine layer of organic detritus. Sub-optimal habitat is characterised by a patchy or shallow covering of fine sediment among larger substrates.  </br>\r\nLampreys were anaesthetised using 2-phenoxy ethanol and were examined on white measuring boards.

Inventory samples (working until no more species could be found) were taken at sites 1 and 4-6.  Heaps of wrack were investigated by sifting material over a tray and watching carefully for beetles, which play dead when disturbed.  Rock pools were investigated by stirring up the bottom and edges to cause the beetles to float, allowing them to be collected using a tea strainer.  Aquatic samples were taken on 14 and 20 May 2015, and 17, 27, and 28 August 2015.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial Coleoptera were sampled using sweep nets and Bugvac (suction sampling).  A modified leaf blower (Husqvarna 125BVX) was used to vacuum sample invertebrates from ground level by pressing the bugvac nozzle to the ground for 10 seconds at five points.  Specimens were emptied from the net into a white plastic tray, collected, and stored in labeled tubes.  We concentrated on bugvac sampling and sweeping areas of woodland with a ground flora of doga^??s mercury in order to find T. elevatus.

We made two visits during mid- and late-summer to record beetles whose emergence coincide with these seasons.  We installed and collected bark traps on 15 June and 24 August 2015 respectively.  We beat vegetation on 15 June 2015 and carried out active searches on 15 and 16 June, and 24 August 2015 on both the Gledswood and Bemersyde estates.  Details of sampling methods are included below.\r\n\r\nBark traps - We used bark traps to sample invertebrate species that live under tree bark.  A trap consisted of two layers of plastic bubble wrap (40 x 40 cm), with bubbles facing each other so as to provide artificial a^??barka^?? habitat.  Dark plastic was used to cover the traps, and they were wrapped around a tree with wire at 1.5 m height.  Traps were then left in situ for a minimum of four weeks to allow invertebrates to colonise this new habitat (Photo 2.2).  Afterwards invertebrates between the traps and tree bark and between the bubble wrap layers were collected and the traps removed.\r\n\r\nBeating and bark brush sampling - A large, soft paint brush was used to dislodge invertebrates (particularly spiders and beetles) from bark into a tray held underneath.  Trees or bushes were then gently beaten so as to dislodge further invertebrates into a white sheet at the base of the tree.  Beating was also used in isolation on some occasions to dislodge invertebrates from young trees or bushes.\r\n\r\nActive searches - Appropriate microhabitats for targeted notified features were searched by hand.  This involved 'grubbing' in the ground layer, overturning stones, and a range of equipment such as a^??pootersa^??, amongst other specific techniques as appropriate.  Saproxylic species were sampled by surveying a variety of niches within the arboreal habitat such as dead trunks, aerial deadwood, rot holes fruiting fungi and loose bark.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, specimens were identified in the field.  If not, specimens were pinned or preserved in isopropanol for later identification in the lab with stereo- or compound-microscopes as appropriate.  Voucher specimens were retained where appropriate.  Where necessary, we compared specimens with museum collections to confirm identification.  We focussed identification effort on the target taxa for notified features.  However, non-target specimens were identified to species level as time allowed, providing a more comprehensive species list for the sites.","purpose":"The survey aimed to detect the presence of the invertebrate assemblage feature (Microscydmus nanus  and Ptinus subpilosus), which is a notified feature of Tweedwood - Gateheugh SSSI, in order to inform the site condition assessment.","geographicalCoverage":"Tweedwood - Gateheugh SSSI","quality":"We have a very high level of confidence in this dataset.

In addition, bugvac sampling (for Heliophanus dampfi) was undertaken at one site (Ochtertyre Moss).\r\n\r\nPitfall traps were usually installed along a transect, along which traps were separated by at least 2 m. Each trap consisted of a plastic cup dug into the ground such that the lip was flush with the substrate surface. Chicken wire was attached to cover the traps in order to exclude small vertebrates.

Specimens were caught using a pooter or large forceps dipped in a 70% isopropanol alcohol mixture, and were then preserved in 70% isopropanol for subsequent identification. Active searches were used for Aranae and Coleoptera species at Barry Links; Aranae species at Caenlochan, Ochtertyre Moss and Torridon Forest; and Coleptera species at Cleghorn Glen, Fannich Hills and Endrick Mouth & Islands.\r\n\r\nBugvac sampling for Heliophanus dampfi at Ochtertyre Moss involved the use of a modified leaf blower (or bugvac)  held flush with the surface vegetation for a second before moving on to a new location within reach of where the surveyor is standing. This is repeated for a duration of 10 seconds. Invertebrates are sucked into the leaf blower and caught in a net. The net is then emptied onto a white tray and invertebrates collected using a pooter or large forceps dipped in 70% isopropanol for transfer to a tube containing 70% isopropanol for preservation.\r\n\r\nWhere Lepidoptera species were part of the notified invertebrate assemblage of a site (Barry Links, Beinn Eighe, Caenloachan, Inverpolly and Rum) these were sampled using visual surveys for day-flying adult insects; light-trapping, a^??wine-ropinga^?? and/or sugaringa^?? for nocturnal moths; and/or active searches for larvae/eggs.\r\n\r\nVisual surveys for day-flying moths were carried out as far as possible under standard conditions recommended for butterfly transects, i.e. between 1045 and 1545 BST, dry conditions, wind speed less than Beaufort scale five, and a temperature of a^?¥13A^°C where sunshine was a^?¥60%, or >17A^°C if overcast. This survey method was used at Beinn Eighe, Caenloachan, Inverpolly and Rum.\r\n\r\nActive searches for eggs or larvae were carried out at Barry Links (for Cupido minimus eggs) and Rum (for Hadena caesia larvae).\r\n\r\nLight trapping for nocturnal moths was carried out either using a a^??Robinsona^?? trap with a mercury vapour (MV) lamp and powered by a generator, or a 12V battery-powered a^??Heatha^?? trap, with an actinic bulb, following the methods summarised in the Moth Recorders Handbook (Randle, 2011). Traps were operated from dusk until dawn, or for a shorter period if wet weather meant that the hot bulbs were at risk from shattering. This survey method was used at Inverpolly and Rum.\r\n\r\nSugaring involved painting artificial nectar (a mixture of brown ale, dark brown sugar and black treacle) onto tree trunks or fence posts at approximately eye level, just before dusk. Wine-roping is an alternative method that uses thick cord or cloth made from absorbent material soaked with a mixture of red wine and sugar. The soaked material was draped over low branches, bushes or fences just before dusk. This survey method was used at Inverpolly.\r\n\r\nAt Beinn Eighe, Odonata species were part of the notified invertebrate assemblage. Surveys for adults involved watching potential basking/ perching sites and breeding pools from suitable vantage points. Each site was observed in suitable weather conditions (temperatures of >17oC, and wind speeds of Beaufort scale 2) for > 1 hour. Larval sampling was undertaken by a^??guddlinga^??, which involves using a colander as a net and sweeping it through emergent vegetation, along the edge or bottom of a pool.\r\n\r\nAt Cleghorn Glen, Mollusca and Trichoptera species were part of the notified invertebrate assemblage.\r\n\r\nSurveys for Mollusca species involved hand searches of bare sand and bank side vegetation were undertaken adjacent to the Mouse Water. Material was also collected and sifted through a 5mm sieve with all species of mollusc identified in the field where possible, or retained for identification on return.\r\n\r\nSurveys for Trichoptera species involved kick sampling of three small streams flowing from the top of the gorge to the Mouse Water using a standard pond net. This involved a shuffling movement upstream of the net, which was held vertically on the riverbed, to disturb the substrate and dislodge invertebrates, which were washed downstream into the net. Kick sampling was undertaken for 10-15 minutes per section. The resulting sample of invertebrates was placed in a large white tray and sorted on the bank side. Representative specimens were extracted and fixed with 99% isopropyl alcohol. On return from the site the specimens were identified to species, where possible, using a stereomicroscope with a maximum magnification of 40 times.\r\n\r\nThis survey method was supplemented with a visual search for Trichoptera larvae attached to rocks, logs or vegetation or free-living on the bed of the stream.","purpose":"The surveys aimed to detect the presence of the notified invertebrate assemblage features of ten SSSIs (Barry Links, Beinn Eighe, Caenlochan, Cleghorn Glen, Endrick Mouth & Islands, Fannich Hills, Inverpolly, Ochtertyre Moss, Rum and Torridon Forest) in order to inform the site condition assessment of each site.","geographicalCoverage":"Barry Links SSSI, Beinn Eighe SSSI, Caenlochan SSSI, Cleghorn Glen SSSI, Endrick Mouth & Islands SSSI, Fannich Hills SSSI, Inverpolly SSSI, Ochtertyre Moss SSSI, Rum and Torridon Forest SSSI","quality":"We have a very high level of confidence in this dataset.

Current survey methods are varied, reflecting lack of knowledge about some species ecology and the difficulties of locating or counting some of them. Most methods are still under development, but generally involve a seach of suitable habitat on the site, focussing on previously recorded locations. Where possible an estimate of abundance and distribution on the site is attempted, so some methods include sampling where the species is locally abundant. Site staff and volunteers in most cases had the required expertise to identify species confidently, or sought expert assistance. Records were captured on, and are actively managed within, iRecord via the NE NNR Priority Species Surveys form, and those records validated online transferred to the NBN Gateway.","purpose":"Surveillance of these species on our NNRs is a direct contribution to our ability to understand the status and trends of some of England's rarest and most threatened species, and therefore supports Outcome 3 of the Biodiversity 2020 Strategy.

For each site, evidence of the presence of a spotted crake varied from a singing male to a bird seen in the autumn. Sites were divided into two groups: high priority and low priority. High priority sites were those at which singing birds had been recorded more than once in the last ten years and extra effort was made to cover all of these sites. Low priority sites were the remainder and within these, less effort was placed on surveying sites where birds had been seen only in the autumn. General habitat data were collected as part of this survey, both from an area of 5 m × 5 m surrounding the spotted crake singing locations and from ten randomly selected 5 m × 5 m squares within sites. Details and description of these data can be found in Gilbert (2002). \r\n<br /><br />\r\nHigh priority sites were visited once a week during May and June (at least eight visits), whilst the remaining low priority sites received three visits, one in the first half of May, the second in the second half of May and the third in the first half of June. Observers were asked to conduct their survey from half an hour after sunset (as soon as it was dark) up to 02:00 hours British Summer Time and preferably to avoid cold, wet and windy conditions. The census method used relies on counting singing males to give a relative index of breeding pairs (Gilbert et al. 1998). Observers were asked to mark on a map the boundary of the site to be covered and the position of listening points within 500 m of all suitable habitats. Observers listened for five minutes at each point and recorded the position of singing birds on a field map, coding all records according to visit and bird number. Spotted crakes heard or seen before or after the survey period, or during an extra visit, were recorded separately.","purpose":"The survey aimed to provide baseline information on the number and distribution of breeding spotted crakes in Britain.","geographicalCoverage":"Sites surveyed in 1999 ranged from north Scotland to the Channel Islands.

Other sightings include opportunistic sightings reported to The Seahorse Trust from members of the public and local fishermen.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"The Seahorse Trust","captureMethod":"The Studland Bay Seahorse Project (SBSP) undertook to examine the presence or absence of seahorses in Studland Bay, with an emphasise on South Beach, which was the main focus of the study area.\r\n\r\nThe survey team selected the area within the site to survey by referring to records and locations that had been surveyed on previous dives and an overall plan of action by the survey leader Neil Garrick-Maidment, which ensured every area within the overall study site, could be covered over a period of time.\r\n\r\nThe dive team which could have been up to 8 to 10 divers were then briefed on the survey techniques to be used, the safety of the divers and the handling and photographing of the seahorses.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at the site the location was logged by Garmin GPS from the water surface at the start of the dive and was left on during the whole of the dive and the digital cameras were also synced to the time and date of the GPS, so that a tracking system could be used (Garmin computer programme) and the exact spot located on the computer programme; pinpointed by date and time.\r\n\r\nWhen a seahorse was located the individual was photographed on either side of the body. No flash photography was used in accordance with the MMO license which was informed by the previous work of The Seahorse Trust (The Seahorse Trust advised or set up all the criteria for the MMO license which is used as standard for anyone wishing to dive with seahorses in the UK) which showed the use of flash can kill seahorses; this is now built into MMO seahorse licenses.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the seahorse was then measured using minimum handling possible, holding a ruler beside the individual as it remained attached to its holdfast. Sex was determined by absence or presence of the brood pouch and sex level (pregnant or not) was determined by size of the brood pouch. Age was estimated by overall size of the animal which was informed from the experience of Neil Garrick-Maidment who has worked with this species for almost 36 years.\r\n\r\nColour was recorded along with any other noticeable details i.e. damage to the individual or obvious markings. (Nb. Colour was also used to determine the emotional state of the seahorse as to whether it was stressed or relaxed, this then determined behaviour of the divers, as to whether the survey continued or was abandoned)\r\n\r\nThe associated habitat was recorded along with any tag number found on the individual. Weather conditions and sea temperature were also noted upon completion of the dive.\r\n\r\nAll the survey work has been carried out under license from the Marine Management organisation (MMO) issued to the SHT director Neil Garrick-Maidment and his agents under that license. The data collected was submitted to the National Seahorse Database (NSD) and verified by director Neil Garrick-Maidment either through photographs or by indepth description following an email / telephone / face to face exchange.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that not all the details listed above are recorded for each sighting. However all sightings submitted to The Seahorse Trust were verified by Neil Garrick-Maidment as described above. Only assured sightings have been submitted into the National Seahorse database and presented within this dataset.\r\n\r\nSome sightings have been rejected if it was suspected that the animal was not even a seahorse or could have been a pipefish. Other sightings have been rejected if the circumstances of the find were too unbelievable or if it was clearly evident form the description that the animal could not have been a seahorse\r\n\r\nOld records and historic records from archives were thoroughly explored and considered for inclusion or deletion. Reasons for deletion could be location, behaviour, poor description that was vague and highly suspect or just very poor recording of details.","purpose":"The bulk of the data was collected as part of the Studland Bay Seahorse Project (SBSP) which was set up following the reports of seahorses in the bay and was to ascertain population densities and species identification for this location and for the general wider area. We also set out to understand more about seahorse migration in the wild and other aspects of seahorse behaviour.","geographicalCoverage":"The dataset is a sub set of the British Seahorse Survey (BSS) and covers the Studland Bay (Dorset) area, in particular the South Beach area.\r\n\r\nThis site of South Beach in Studland Bay was chosen because initial surveys showed a very high presence of Spiny Seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus) on the site with up to 9 seahorses being recorded on individual dives and a total of 40 individual seahorses identified on the site overall in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe initial survey was to understand more about the species but as the Studland Bay Seahorse Project (SBSP) developed we soon came to realise that the habitat the seahorses live in, primarily seagrass was under threat from illegal moorings and overuse of anchors\r\n\r\nWe restricted the surveys to South Beach within the bay because the concentration of seahorses were on the site and the total area of the site (approximately 1km by 1km was a large enough area to concentrate on within the number of volunteers we had.\r\n\r\nAdditional sightings are recorded from volunteers who have submitted sightings from the wider Studland Bay area. The entire area of South Beach in Studland Bay formed the core of the Studland Bay Seahorse Project (SBSP) and is approximately 1 km squared.","quality":"We are 100% confident in the data provided as they were part of an organised survey and all records were verified by the leading seahorse expert in the UK, Mr Neil Garrick-Maidment following photographic identification and/or extensive e-mail or phone call conversatiosn to garner additional information and/or to clarify information if initial results were confusing.\r\n\r\nAll data collected by Seahorse Trust surveyors or other surveyors well known to The Seahorse Trust sre considered as very high in confidence not just in data source, data processing, data validation but also record collation.\r\n\r\nThere are a tiny handful of only a couple of records that may appear to be low in confidence but each and every record was followed up with further confirmation (verbal or written) by the Seahorse Trust director, Neil Garrick-Maidment and they are as accurate as is possible.","additionalInformation":"The National Seahorse Database (NSD) is held and administered by The Seahorse Trust (SHT) and has been since 1994 when it was founded","accessConstraints":"Seahorses are a fragile, highly sensitive, vulnerable and very territorial species, especially during the breeding season.

Surveys were under taken on average once every 2 weeks (once or twice a week in the summer) and seahorses were usually found from April until September when they came inshore to breed. Surveys were also undertaken during the rest of the year when seahorses had migrated into deeper water to overwinter and with a few exceptions this confirmed the migratory nature of the species on exposed coastlines.\r\n\r\nThe Studland Bay Seahorse Project (SBSP) started in 2008/9 and all sightings within that survey which make up over 90% of sightings submitted to the NBN for this site have been collected by the trained survey team from The Seahorse Trust.

","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"Scottish Natural Heritage","captureMethod":"Loch of Butterstone Slender Naiad bed was divided up into 5 areas, according to the perceived densities of the plant, for quadrat sampling by different divers. Five random quadrats were recorded in areas 1, 4 and 5, and 20 random quadrats in areas 2 and 3. The number of quadrats in each area was determined by the time available. As underwater visibility was only a few centimetres, the quadrats were placed by the diver hovering above the loch bed, unable to see the vegetation, and dropping the quadrat. The bright white colour of the quadrat aided its relocation. \r\nLoch of Craiglush was surveyed on 3 and 4 July 1997. With reasonable underwater visibility of approximately 1 m, the reconnaissance snorkel was completed in just over half a day. A team of four surveyors snorkelled around the whole perimeter of the loch, duck diving to depths of up to 5 m.\r\nDue to the restricted nature of the Slender Naiad bed and the clumped distribution of the plant in natural breaks in the vegetation, the method selected for detailed survey was a plant count along a series of parallel belt transects. The area was first delineated by sub-aqua divers swimming along the outermost edges. 3 m canes with plastic marker buoys were placed regularly in the bottom mud along the perimeter. Dive weights attached to buoys were used in deeper water. Four transects were laid, running along the length of the bed. \r\nOne diver swam the length of each transect and recorded details from a band 1m wide, along either side of the transect (an arm's length). Each 100 m transect thus covered 200 m2. \r\n","purpose":"The survey was carried out to determine the current status of Najas flexilis (slender naiad) in Loch of Craiglush, Loch of the Lowes and Loch of Butterstone as N. flexilis is a Red Data species. Further impetus to the study was given by the fact that it has been proposed to designate the three lochs as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) mainly because of the presence of N. flexilis. The need to record the present distribution and occurrence of N. flexilis in the lochs is vitally important to confirm its presence, to justify the lochs' proposed status as an SAC and to aid future monitoring of this species.","geographicalCoverage":"Perthshire, Scotland","quality":"High: Survey was carried out by an experienced contractor, using approved methodology.

The Swift Inventory was initially compiled in 2009, and will be updated annually. The Swift Inventory is intended to be a comprehensive inventory of swift breeding sites in the UK. It collates data from a variety of sources, primarily a public request for information and local surveys. This dataset contains reports of common swifts (Apus apus) flying at rooftop level, calling with their characteristic screaming sound. This behaviour indicates that swifts are probably nesting nearby. An accompanying dataset of swift nest sites is also available on the NBN.\r\n\r\nThe Swift Inventory is a cooperative project involving the support of Concern for Swifts - Scotland, London's Swifts, Northern Ireland Swifts, the RSPB, Swift Conservation and UK Swifts.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"RSPB","captureMethod":"The Swift Inventory collates data about low-level screaming swifts from as many sources as possible. In 2009, members of the public were asked to complete a form to report screaming parties of swifts, flying at rooftop level. Records collected in 2009, and in previous years, were provided by swift conservation groups (Concern for Swifts - Scotland, London's Swifts, Northern Ireland Swifts, Swift Conservation and UK Swifts). Data were also drawn from previous RSPB surveys (swift survey in 2007, and Homes for Wildlife survey in 2008). The data source is included as an attribute in the dataset. The Inventory will be updated annually. In 2010, an interactive online form was used for reporting records. Additional records were contributed by Kirtlington Wildlife and Conservation Society, Cambridgeshire Bird Club, Dorset Wildlife Trust, Bristol Naturalists Society, Glasgow Museums BRC, SOC-Highland and Perth and Kinross Council, Ludlow 21.\r\n\r\nThe Count attribute is reported as the approximate count of swifts. It is difficult to get an exact count of the number of low-flying swifts, because of their speed, and the likely proximity to buildings, which obscure the swifts from view. When a count range was reported, the mean value is included in the dataset. The count attribute may refer to either, the approximate number seen at a site on one occasion, or the approximate number seen over numerous occasions.","purpose":"The population of swifts in the UK declined by 29% between 1995 and 2009. While the cause of the decline is not fully understood, it is known that nest sites have been lost. Swifts often nest in old buildings, and these nest sites may be susceptible to renovations, repair, or demolition. The Swift Inventory intends to make the locations of swift nesting sites publicly available to anyone likely to be involved in planning or approving construction (e.g. local authorities, local record centres, contractors) to promote swift conservation.","geographicalCoverage":"Coverage is UK wide. There may be some bias towards more densely populated areas.\r\n\r\nMany records were provided without adequate geographic information to enable them to be mapped. Where possible, a postcode was assigned to these records using Royal Mail's Postcode Finder. All records with valid postcodes were assigned a grid reference corresponding to the centroid of the postcode area. For streets spanning multiple postcode areas, the grid reference corresponds to the centroid of a central postcode on the street. Where it was not possible to assign a postcode to a location, Google, Google Maps or Ordinance Survey maps were used to assign latitude and longitude or a grid reference. Records with latitude and longitude were mapped at 1 km resolution. In some cases, grid references were assigned by locating villages on maps. The resolution of these records ranged from 1 - 10 km.

The Swift Inventory was initially compiled in 2009, and will be updated annually. The dataset is intended to be a comprehensive inventory of common swift (Apus apus) nesting sites, and collates data from a variety of sources, primarily a public request for information and local surveys. An accompanying dataset of low-level screaming swifts (probable breeders) is also available on the NBN.\r\n\r\nThe Swift Inventory is a cooperative project involving the support of Concern for Swifts - Scotland, London's Swifts, Northern Ireland Swifts, the RSPB, Swift Conservation and UK Swifts.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"RSPB","captureMethod":"The Swift Inventory collates data about swift nest sites from as many sources as possible. In 2009, members of the public were asked to complete a form to report known swift nest sites. Sites that were previously used by swifts, but that are no longer used, were also recorded. Records collected in 2009, and in previous years, were provided by swift conservation groups (Concern for Swifts - Scotland, London's Swifts, Northern Ireland Swifts, Swift Conservation and UK Swifts). Data were also drawn from previous RSPB surveys (swift survey in 2007, and Homes for Wildlife survey in 2008). The data source is included as an attribute in the dataset. In 2010, an interactive online form was used for reporting records. Additional records were contributed by Kirtlington Wildlife and Conservation Society, Cambridgeshire Bird Club, Dorset Wildlife Trust, Bristol Naturalists Society, Glasgow Museums BRC, Ludlow 21, SOC-Highland and Perth and Kinross Council. The Inventory will be updated annually.\r\n\r\nThe Count attribute is reported as the approximate count of nests. Due to the numerous data sources, the count attribute may refer to either the approximate number seen at a site on one occasion, or on numerous occasions.","purpose":"The population of swifts in the UK declined by 29% between 1995 and 2009. While the cause of the decline is not fully understood, it is known that nest sites have been lost. Swifts often nest in old buildings, and these nest sites may be susceptible to renovations, repair, or demolition. The Swift Inventory intends to make known locations of swift nest sites publicly available to anyone likely to be involved in planning or approving such construction (e.g. local authorities, local record centres, contractors) to promote swift conservation.","geographicalCoverage":"Coverage is UK wide. There may be some bias towards more densely populated areas. Many records were provided without adequate geographic information to enable them to be mapped. Where possible, a postcode was assigned to these records using Royal Mail's Postcode Finder. All records with valid postcodes were assigned a grid reference corresponding to the centroid of the postcode area. For streets spanning multiple postcode areas, the grid reference corresponds to the centroid of a central postcode on the street. Where it was not possible to assign a postcode to a location, Google, Google Maps or Ordinance Survey maps were used to assign latitude and longitude or a grid reference. Records with latitude and longitude were mapped at 1 km resolution, with the reported grid reference corresponding to the bottom left hand corner of the grid square. In some cases, grid references were assigned by locating villages on maps. The resolution of these records ranged from 1 - 10 km, and the reported grid reference corresponds to the bottom left hand corner of the grid square. More detail about the format of the grid reference is provided in the dataset.","quality":"The public has submitted many of these data.

At each site N. flexilis presence or absence was recorded. The location of N. flexilis populations was determined within a loch from past records, where available, especially the Scottish Loch Survey data and the results of previous surveys for the plant. Three basic survey methods were used to locate N. flexilis within the lake; boat, shoreline and snorkel surveys.  Snorkel surveys were considered the most effective for finding N. flexilis, and were adopted as the standard approach wherever feasible. Boats were used when the lakes were particularly large and there was no knowledge of exactly where the plant could be found; this enabled a larger area to be surveyed. When boats were not available, a shoreline search was carried out. Shoreline search included searching the drift, wading into the water as far as safety would allow, and throwing grapnels into the deeper water. ","purpose":"Najas flexilis (Willd.) Rostk. & Schmidt is a submerged rooted macrophyte occurring in lakes. It is a Red Data Book species and is listed in Annexes II and IV of the EC Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC. It is also protected under domestic legislation, being listed in Schedule 8 of The Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981, and Schedule 4 of The Conservation (Natural Habitats & c.) Regulations, 1994. In order to protect this species information is required on the ecological tolerances of the plant and the main threats to the species need to be elucidated. In addition, effective monitoring strategies are required to identify when and where the plant is endangered. The Biodiversity Action Plan for this species suggests reintroduction of N. flexilis to sites where the species has become extinct in recent years. If this is to occur information is required on when to reintroduce the plant, in what form (seed or plant) and from where. This study attempts to address some of these gaps in our knowledge of the ecology of N. flexilis.","geographicalCoverage":"Scotland","quality":"High: Survey was carried out by an experienced contractor, using approved methodology.

Cobnut plats are also included. \n</br>\nThere are many regional variations on this theme, including apple, pear, cherry, plum, damson, and walnut orchards. Although cobnut plat structure and management varies from fruit tree orchards and has affinities with coppice woodland, they are also included in the definition.\n","typeName":"Habitat","organisationName":"Natural England","captureMethod":"For the purpose of the inventory, a mapping definition is used as follows: \n“to be mapped as an orchard, the crown edges of trees must be within 20 m of each other to be included in the orchard patch, and there must be five or more trees within 20 m of each other’s crown edges. Land parcels with fewer than five trees or scattered trees with crown edges more than 20 m apart are identified as relict orchards and, where appropriate, considered as potential restoration sites.” (Robertson, 2006).\nA desk-top study has been undertaken to compile a GIS digital layer of traditional orchard polygons for each of the counties, or where appropriate, Unitary Authorities, of England.  A GIS layer of traditional orchards in Environmental Stewardship schemes was provided by Natural England. This included agreement numbers and size data from 2006 – 2010.  Information was also acquired, where it existed, from local record centres, Local Authorities and from other orchard projects undertaken at a local level. This was cross-referenced with aerial photograph information.\n","purpose":"Traditional orchards are a long-established and widely distributed habitat and make a significant contribution to biodiversity, landscape character and local distinctiveness across the UK. ","geographicalCoverage":"England","quality":"The reliability of priority habitat determination for each patch of habitat on the map was judged according to a series of determination criteria related to the relative quality of the data sets used to construct the inventory. Datasets containing information about orchards were  allocated a ‘Quality of interpretation’ rating, ranging from high to low, dependent on their quality. Quality was assessed using age of the survey data and level of survey detail.  Together, these factors indicated the reliability in interpretation of the BAP priority type from this data source. Data sources supplied three critical pieces of priority habitat information: the presence of an orchard, the type of orchard (traditional not intensive) and boundary of the orchard. Some component  data sources only supplied part of the information and thus had a lower quality rating in themselves. In combination with other data however, higher quality interpretation was possible. The combination of data sources to supply the three critical pieces of information about orchards was the underlying principle in the methodology for the traditional orchard inventory compilation 2006-2011. The aerial photography data source was an exception, as by itself it is often capable of supplying all three pieces of information with a high degree of accuracy. A complicating factor is that the data sources described in Table 2 varied in quality within each source. As far as possible, the matrix attempts to deal with this variation. External data sources are potentially so variable that an ‘average’ rating is entered in the matrix but the quality of each one should be assessed on a case by case basis.

In brief, a fixed-route walk (transect) is established at a site and butterflies are recorded along the route on a regular (weekly) basis under reasonable weather conditions for a number of years. Transect routes are chosen to sample evenly the habitat types and management activity on sites. Care is taken in choosing a transect route as it must then remain fixed to enable butterfly sightings to be compared from year to year. Transects are typically about 2-4km long, taking between 45 minutes and two hours to walk, and are divided into sections corresponding to different habitat or management units.\r\n\r\nButterflies are recorded in a fixed width band (typically 5m wide) along the transect each week from the beginning of April until the end of September yielding, ideally, 26 counts per year. Transect walks are undertaken between 10.45am and 3.45pm and only when weather conditions are suitable for butterfly activity: dry conditions, wind speed less than Beaufort scale 5, and temperature 13A^A^°C or greater if there is at least 60% sunshine, or more than 17A^A^°C if overcast. Due to the vagaries of the British and Irish weather, it is rare in practice to achieve a full set of 26 weekly counts.

Malls Mire is approximately 8ha in area and habitats comprise mixed plantation, marshy grassland and wet woodland. The site is near Rutherglen and situated adjacent to the M74 and railway, housing estates and amenity grassland. The adjacent land-use poses an ecological barrier to the site; the closest semi-natural greenspace is over 500m away beyond the M74. For this reason, Malls Mire is an extremely important resource to its invertebrate fauna.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"Caledonian Conservation Ltd","captureMethod":"A wide variety of sampling methods were used, including:\r\n\r\nPitfall traps - Each pitfall trap consisted of a plastic cup dug into the ground so that the lip was flush with the substrate surface.  Two small holes were punched through the plastic just below the rim for drainage to prevent loss of catch if flooded by rainwater.  Chicken-wire was used to cover traps so as to prevent small vertebrates from becoming trapped, and was attached so as to ensure that it could not be dislodged.  A mixture of 70% propylene glycol antifreeze and 30% water was added to a depth of 2.5cm in each trap, and a drop of washing-up liquid was used to break surface tension.  Traps were set in four transects of five traps located in different habitats in Malls Mire.  Traps were left in situ for two weeks, at which point the catches were collected and transferred to a container and preserved in a 70% isopropanol and 30% water mixture.  Traps were reset every two weeks from 23 June to 18 September 2014, totalling seven rounds of trapping.  Traps were emptied and reset by Urban Roots volunteers.\r\n\r\nBark traps - Bark traps were used to sample invertebrates that live under tree bark.  The traps consisted of two layers of plastic bubble wrap, with bubbles facing each other so as to provide artificial bark habitat 40x40cm in size.  Dark plastic was used to cover the outside of the trap to prevent light from penetrating the clear plastic, and the trap was wrapped around a tree at 1.5 m height, attached using wire.  The traps were left in situ from 9 June to 24 September 2014 (15 weeks) before collection, allowing invertebrates to colonise this new habitat.  Invertebrates were collected from the space between the trap and the tree as well as from between the layers of bubble wrap.  Specimens were transferred to a container and preserved in a 70% isopropanol and 30% water mixture.  A total of 26 bark traps were fitted to trees of varying location, aspect, species and life stage.\r\n\r\nBugvac (suction sampling) - A modified leaf blower (Husqvarna 125BVX) was used to suction sample invertebrates from ground level.  This has proven the most effective method of establishing the presence of species that live in less accessible micro-habitats such as the base of vegetation, or for small invertebrates which are often under-recorded by more traditional sampling techniques (Wilson et al. 1993).  Each sample involved pressing the bugvac nozzle to the ground for 10 seconds at five points.  Specimens were then emptied from the net into a white plastic tray, collected with forceps dipped in 70% isopropyl alcohol, and transferred to a plastic collection tube containing 70% isopropyl alcohol.  Bugvac samples were collected on 9 June and 23 June 2014.\r\n\r\nSweep netting - A 30 cm diameter canvas insect net with a sturdy metal frame was used for sweep netting low vegetation such as grasses or rushes.  One sample involved walking slowly forward  and conducting 20 sweeps from side to side.  Invertebrates trapped within the net were collected using a suction pooter and transferred to a plastic collection tube containing 70% isopropyl alcohol.  Sweep netting was carried out on 23 June 2014.\r\n\r\nActive searches - Various microhabitats were searched by hand.  This involved 'grubbing' in the ground layer, overturning stones, and using a range of equipment such as pooters and tuning forks (to lure spiders out onto their webs), amongst other specific techniques as appropriate.  Active searches were undertaken on 9 June 2014, with the assistance of children from St. Brigida^??s Primary School.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, specimens were identified in the field. Where this was not possible, or where sample methods were obligately fatal specimens were preserved in 70% isopropanol for later identification in the lab with stereo-microscopes as appropriate. Voucher specimens were retained where appropriate. Where necessary, specimens were compared with museum collections to confirm identification.

Records have been submitted since 1979 to the Water Beetle Recording Scheme for incorporation into a single database.  Earlier records compiled on card indexes by the late Frank and Jack Balfour-Browne and other workers before 1979 are also incorporated into the database.

Data were compiled by the Scheme Organiser onto a Recorder database, and have been checked and validated prior to being submitted to the NBN Gateway.   However, coverage of the country has been uneven in different places over time, and interpretation of species distributions needs to be approached with care.   While many species show a probably accurate representation of their distribution and occurrence, other species, particularly commoner ones, are known to be under-recorded in many areas.

It is a species of high to moderate conservation concern subject to a national Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP).  \r\nThe dataset contains records from the national surveys of breeding Woodlark in 1986, 1997 and 2006.  These were organised and run by the BTO (in 1986 on its own, in 1997 in conjunction with RSPB, JNCC and English Nature (now Natural England) and in 2006 in conjunction with RSPB, Natural England and the Forestry Commission in England).\r\nIn 1986 it was estimated that there were 250 territories in the UK concentrated in five regions: south-west England, New Forest/Dorset, Hampshire/Surrey border, Breckland and the Suffolk coast.  The dataset records the locations of 241 pairs; the remaining 9 pairs are an estimate for those areas not covered well.  Habitat occupancy differed between regions.  Most birds were found in young conifer plantations and heathland, but neither of these habitats was important in the south-west where birds used a variety of habitats including marginal farmland.  For more information see Sitters <i>et al</i>. (1996), <i>Bird Study</i> 43: 172-187.\r\nIn 1997 between 1426 and 1552 woodlark territories were located in Britain -- the dataset includes all 1552 territory locations but it is not certain that more than 1426 became breeding territories.  The five regions of population that were apparent in 1986 all showed major increases, in particular in Breckland and the Suffolk Sandlings.  Over 85% of territories occurred on heathland or within forest plantations, but the ratio varied between regions: plantations were more commonly used in the north and east, whereas more birds utilised heathland in the south.  Woodlarks in Devon bred almost exclusively on farmland.  More than three-quarters of the forest population was found in young plantations, particularly in stands of two and three year old trees.  Most territories were located on sandy soils, with nearly 70% specifically as on acid sandy soils.  For more information see Wotton & Gillings (2000), <i>Bird Study</i> 47: 212-224. \r\nThe 2006 survey gave a population estimate of 3064 territories (with 95% confidence limits 2472 - 3687), and a range expansion of 46% since 1997.  The dataset records the location of the 1757 territories noted by the observers contributing to the survey.  This survey demonstrated that the population had increased to meet the BAP targets set in 1996 for population size and range expansions in England, and that it is on schedule to meet targets in Wales.  The species has responded to heathland conservation restoration projects and is highly dependent on forest management.  For more information, see Conway <i>et al</i>. (2009), <i>Bird Study</i> 56: 310-325.","typeName":"Taxon","organisationName":"British Trust for Ornithology","captureMethod":"1986 survey:  Observers were asked to search all sites known to have been occupied by Woodlarks in any breeding season since 1975.

Two recording cards were used, a 'site card' for noting all breeding season (March to August) observations of Woodlarks in a 10-km square and a 'habitat card' for describing the habitat and vegetation.  Observations were recorded by 1-km square within each 10km square covered. \r\n1997 survey:  Observers visited all sites where Woodlarks bred between 1986 and 1996, and other sites with suitable habitats in areas surrounding the known breeding range.  Observers were asked to visit each site three times, with visits falling within the following time periods: 15/2 to 21/3, 22/3 to 25/4, 26/4 to 1/6.  Almost 40% of the sites were visited more than three times, and in such circumstances observers were asked to note the actual number of visits made.  It was asked that all visits should be made on clear, dry mornings with little wind.  All areas of suitable habitat on each site were searched to within 100m where possible.  Observers were asked to record the number of singing males and other territorial contacts located during each visit by marking them on a map (1:10000 or 1:12500) using the BTO standard territory mapping symbols.  The estimated number of territories for the site (minimum and maximum) was entered on the recording form at the end of the survey.  Information on land-use and habitat around each territory was also collected.\r\n(Notes:  1) By the time of the 1997 survey much more was known about the biology of Woodlarks in Britain and so to avoid potential problems with separating territories after completion of the first brood, the survey stopped before June.  2) The unit for this survey was the site although grid references were collected as well. 3) Subsequently central territory locations were plotted in GIS, taken from original survey maps.)  \r\n2006 survey:  The unit of survey coverage was the 1-km square and observers were requested to completely cover each designated square, walking within 100m of all areas of suitable habitat to maximize the detection of territorial individuals.  Squares for survey were either 'core' 1-km squares, those which had been occupied in 1997 or subsequently, or were in Special Protection Areas designated for breeding Woodlarks in parts of East Anglia, the New Forest area and Dorset, or in a stratified random sample of squares containing suitable habitat or soil type, up to 10km from known breeding sites.  However, the survey was widely publicized in order to attract as many 'casual' records as possible, which in 2006 did include a number of records from outside the known breeding range.\r\n</br>\r\nA minimum of two visits was required, one within each of the periods 15/2 - 31/3 and 1/4 - 31/5, and ideally at least 3 weeks apart.  Timing of visits was recommended to take place before midday on mild, clear, dry days with little wind.  Every encounter with Woodlarks was recorded on a site map and these were analysed using GIS software to determine the number of territories present.  Statistical methods were used to extrapolate from sampled squares in the buffer zones, and boot-strapping resampling was used to calculate confidence limits on the figures obtained.\r\nThe survey unit was the territory, defined as containing a singing male, a pair exhibiting breeding activity, individuals present on more than one visit, or with two individuals present.\r\nHabitat type was recorded on a hierarchical scale for all bird registrations.","purpose":"The stated aim of each survey was to provide an accurate assessment of the population and distribution of Woodlarks in Britain and how these had changed since previous surveys.  ","geographicalCoverage":"1986 survey:  restricted to southern and eastern England, the known range at the time.\r\n1997 survey:  all sites where Woodlarks bred between 1986 and 1996, along with other suitable habitats in areas surrounding the known breeding range.  In practice sites were only in England.\r\n2006 survey:  all sites where Woodlarks bred within the previous ten years or so, along with other suitable habitats within 10km of the known breeding range.  Suitable forests were defined as plantations that contained either recently cleared compartments or those replanted in the last seven years.  Other areas of open space within forests, such as heathland and rides, were also surveyed.  In the southwest of England, woodlarks breed almost entirely on farmland, so it was impossible to define suitable sites for coverage.  All tetrads in Devon that had ever held a breeding Woodlark were surveyed.  For other counties where small numbers of woodlarks occurred or where there were historical breeding records, sites were visited on an ad hoc basis.\r\nA total of 3619 1-km squares were surveyed, about two-thirds in core areas and one third in the sample within the buffer zones.\r\n</br>\r\nIn all three surveys squares/sites where no woodlarks were found are included with 'zero abundance' for completeness.  However it is currently not possible to display these zero records on the NBN, but they can be made available upon request from the data provider.","quality":"As sites to be surveyed for all three surveys were primarily chosen on the basis of being previously known sites for the time, it is likely that some occupied territories will have been overlooked.  This is particularly likely in those areas, such as south-west England, where the population is thinly scattered.  Furthermore, the species can be difficult to census effectively when abundance is low; and it was noted this too may have been a particular problem in the south-west.  The Dorset population in 1997 may also have been underestimated, since considerably more woodlarks were reported in 1991 and 1992 than in 1997.\r\n</br>\r\nIn all cases the surveys were widely publicized in order to attract as many 'casual' records as possible, and despite some differences in survey technique between the surveys, they are considered to be comparable.\r\n</br>\r\nFor 2006, by using the various statistical techniques the organisers are confident that the total numbers and overall range found encompasses the whole although the dataset, as presented, clearly does not include every Woodlark territory in England in 2006.","additionalInformation":"Each of the 3 surveys has been formally published.  \r\n1986 survey:  Sitters H.P., Fuller R.J., Hoblyn R.A., Wright M.T., Cowie N. & Bowden C.G.R.  1996.
